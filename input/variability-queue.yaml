# Variability Test Queue
# Tracks paper/run combinations for the full pipeline variability test
#
# Protocol:
# 1. User starts fresh session
# 2. User runs /variability-run
# 3. Claude finds next pending run, executes full pipeline, updates queue
# 4. User runs /clear to reset context
# 5. Repeat until all runs complete
#
# Status values: pending | in_progress | completed | error
