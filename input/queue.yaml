# Paper Diversity Notes:
#
# This corpus includes diverse HASS methodologies:
# - Quantitative modelling (sobotkova-et-al-2024)

# - Landscape analysis (eftimoski-et-al-2017)
# - Remote sensing (ross-et-al-2009)
# - Archaeological synthesis (penske-et-al-2023)
# - Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (connor-et-al-2013)
# - Literary/historical interpretation (ross-2005)
#
# Paper characteristics vary:
# - Length: 166K (ross-2005) to 13M (penske-et-al-2023)
# - Methods transparency: High (technical papers) to Lower (interpretive)
# - Evidence types: Quantitative data, qualitative observations, textual analysis
# - Domains: Archaeology, ancient history, environmental science
#
# Testing priorities:
# 1. Run-to-run variation (sobotkova-et-al-2023 re-extraction)
# 2. Generalization across method types
# 3. Handling different transparency levels
# 4. Extraction quality across domains
