  - path: sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2024 - Validating Predictions of Burial Mounds with Field.pdf
    slug: sobotkova-et-al-2024
    status: completed
    notes: "Predictive modelling validation paper. Tests extraction on quantitative validation methods. COMPLETED - RUN-10 full 7-pass re-extraction successfully addressed RUN-01 under-extraction. Evidence extraction substantially improved (+123%). All execution artifacts preserved. 100% sourcing compliance achieved."
    checkpoint: "EXTRACTION COMPLETE - 100 total items (38 evidence, 30 claims, 9 implicit_arguments, 4 research_designs, 7 methods, 12 protocols). Validation: PASS. Implicit RDMAP: 13.0% (3/23 items). Consolidation: 2.5% overall (appropriate for quantitative validation paper). Cross-references verified and repaired."
    previous_runs:
      - RUN-01: 85 items (17 evidence, 34 claims, 7 implicit_arguments, 3 research_designs, 10 methods, 14 protocols) - SPARSE, missing execution scripts
      - RUN-10: 100 items (38 evidence, 30 claims, 9 implicit_arguments, 4 research_designs, 7 methods, 12 protocols) - Complete 7-pass extraction with systematic methodology

  - path: sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2021 - Deploying an offline, multi-user mobile system for.pdf
    slug: sobotkova-et-al-2021
    status: completed
    notes: Mobile GIS deployment paper. Tests extraction on system implementation and field deployment. COMPLETED - 6-pass extraction with 100% sourcing completeness. System implementation paper yielded high RDMAP density (30 items) with detailed workflows. Conservative consolidation (6.25%) appropriate for well-differentiated technical procedures.
    checkpoint: "EXTRACTION COMPLETE - 175 total items (66 evidence, 73 claims, 6 implicit_arguments, 2 research_designs, 8 methods, 20 protocols). Validation: PASS. Implicit RDMAP: 30.0% (9/30 items). RDMAP consolidations: 2 (P001→P011, P002→P012 workflow integrations)."

    slug: eftimoski-et-al-2017
    status: completed
    notes: Landscape archaeology paper. Predictive modelling of burial mound vulnerability using ordered logit. COMPLETED - 6-pass extraction with 100% sourcing completeness.
    checkpoint: "EXTRACTION COMPLETE - 153 total items (32 evidence, 97 claims, 8 implicit_arguments, 2 research_designs, 4 methods, 10 protocols). Validation: PASS. Implicit RDMAP: 18.75% (3/16 items). Rationalization: Conservative 2% claims reduction appropriate for well-differentiated technical paper."

  - path: sources/original-pdf/Ross et al. - 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy.pdf
    slug: ross-et-al-2009
    status: completed
    notes: Remote sensing methodology paper. Evaluates QuickBird satellite imagery vs. field survey for archaeological prospection in 100 sq km study area, Italy. Comparative methodology testing detection rates, efficiency, false positives/negatives. High-resolution multispectral imagery analysis. COMPLETED - 6-pass extraction with 100% sourcing completeness.
    checkpoint: "EXTRACTION COMPLETE - 319 total items (112 evidence, 135 claims, 31 implicit_arguments, 4 research_designs, 12 methods, 25 protocols). Validation: PASS (with 4 acceptable warnings). Implicit RDMAP: 19.5% (8/41 items). Rationalization: Conservative 12.3% claims and 8.9% RDMAP reductions appropriate for well-differentiated technical paper. Cross-reference repair applied (19 fixes). Total extraction time: 6 passes across 6 section groups."

# Paper Diversity Notes:
#
# This corpus includes diverse HASS methodologies:
# - Quantitative modelling (sobotkova-et-al-2024)
# - System implementation (sobotkova-et-al-2021, sobotkova-et-al-2023)
# - Landscape analysis (eftimoski-et-al-2017)
# - Remote sensing (ross-et-al-2009)
# - Archaeological synthesis (penske-et-al-2023)
# - Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (connor-et-al-2013)
# - Literary/historical interpretation (ross-2005)
#
# Paper characteristics vary:
# - Length: 166K (ross-2005) to 13M (penske-et-al-2023)
# - Methods transparency: High (technical papers) to Lower (interpretive)
# - Evidence types: Quantitative data, qualitative observations, textual analysis
# - Domains: Archaeology, ancient history, environmental science
#
# Testing priorities:
# 1. Run-to-run variation (sobotkova-et-al-2023 re-extraction)
# 2. Generalization across method types
# 3. Handling different transparency levels
# 4. Extraction quality across domains
