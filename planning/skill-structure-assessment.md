# Research Assessor Skill Structure Assessment

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Reviewer**: skill-creator skill assessment
**Current Version**: 2.6.2+ (with implicit improvements)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **Structure is EXCELLENT - Minor improvements recommended**

The research-assessor skill follows skill-creator best practices nearly perfectly:
- Proper SKILL.md with metadata
- All references in `references/` directory
- Logical subdirectory organisation (checklists/, examples/, schema/)
- No misplaced files in root directory

**Issue Found**: README.md in references/ (should not exist per skill-creator guidance)

**Recommendation**: Merge references/README.md content into SKILL_README.md (archive version), then delete references/README.md

| **Logical subdirectories** | ✅ PASS | checklists/, examples/, schema/ well-organised |
| **Scripts separate** | ✅ PASS | No scripts in skill (they're in extraction-system/scripts/) |
| **Assets separate** | ✅ PASS | No assets needed for this skill |

---

## File Placement Analysis

### ✅ Correctly Placed Files

**Root Level:**
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill file (required) ✅

**references/ (Core References):**
- `extraction-fundamentals.md` - Universal sourcing requirements ✅
- `verbatim-quote-requirements.md` - Verbatim quote guidance ✅
- `verification-procedures.md` - Pass 3 validation procedures ✅
- `research-design-extraction-guide.md` - Research Design guidance ✅

**references/checklists/ (Decision Frameworks):**
- `consolidation-patterns.md` - Lump vs split guidance ✅
- `tier-assignment-guide.md` - Design/Method/Protocol decisions ✅
- `expected-information.md` - Completeness checklists ✅

**references/schema/ (Schema Documentation):**
- `schema-guide.md` - Human-readable schema docs ✅

**references/examples/ (Worked Examples):**
- `sobotkova-example.md` - Complete worked extraction ✅

### ⚠️ Issue: references/README.md

**Problem**: README.md exists in references/ directory

**Skill-Creator Guidance**:
- Skills should NOT have README files
- README causes confusion (which file is the entry point?)
- Navigation/structure info should be in SKILL.md or archive docs

**Current Content**: references/README.md contains:
- Version info (2.6.2)
- Directory structure overview
- Usage patterns
- Quick reference

**Solution**:
1. Merge useful content into SKILL_README.md (archive/documentation version)
2. Delete references/README.md from skill
3. SKILL.md already has adequate navigation guidance

---

## Progressive Disclosure Assessment

Skill uses three-level loading system effectively:

### Level 1: Metadata (Always in Context)
```yaml
name: research-assessor
description: [clear description of when to use]
```
✅ **Assessment**: Concise, specific, triggers appropriately

### Level 2: SKILL.md Body (When Skill Triggers)
- Size: 10 KB ✅ (within <5k word guideline)
- Content: Workflow guidance, reference navigation
- Structure: Clear step-by-step process
✅ **Assessment**: Lean, focuses on procedure, points to references

### Level 3: Bundled Resources (As Needed)
- References loaded on-demand by Claude
- Organised logically for discovery
- Sizes appropriate (7-59 KB per file)
✅ **Assessment**: Efficient context use, loads only what's needed

---

## Separation of Concerns Assessment

### ✅ What's in the Skill (Stable Framework)
- Object type definitions (Evidence, Claims, RDMAP)
- Core extraction principles (explicit vs implicit)
- Sourcing requirements (verbatim_quote, trigger_text)
- Decision frameworks (tier assignment, consolidation)
- Recognition patterns (implicit RDMAP, implicit arguments)
- Schema definitions

### ✅ What's NOT in the Skill (Evolving Prompts)
- Pass-specific instructions (in extraction-system/prompts/)
- Workflow orchestration (in input/WORKFLOW.md)
- Paper-specific details
- Execution scripts (in extraction-system/scripts/)

✅ **Assessment**: Excellent separation - framework stable while prompts can evolve

---

## Reference File Organisation Assessment

### Current Grouping Logic

**Top-Level References** (extraction-fundamentals.md, verbatim-quote-requirements.md, verification-procedures.md, research-design-extraction-guide.md):
- **Rationale**: Universal/foundational docs used across all passes
- **Assessment**: ✅ Correct - these are "always read first" docs

**checklists/** (consolidation-patterns.md, tier-assignment-guide.md, expected-information.md):
- **Rationale**: Decision frameworks consulted when uncertain
- **Assessment**: ✅ Correct - these are "when uncertain, consult" docs

**schema/** (schema-guide.md):
- **Rationale**: Structural reference for object definitions
- **Assessment**: ✅ Correct - schema is its own category

**examples/** (sobotkova-example.md):
- **Rationale**: Worked examples for learning/reference
- **Assessment**: ✅ Correct - examples are distinct from guidance

### Alternative Considered: Flat Structure

Could all files be in references/ without subdirectories?
- **No** - 11 files would be hard to navigate
- Current structure aids discovery
- Logical grouping matches usage patterns

✅ **Assessment**: Current subdirectory structure is optimal

---

## Template Scripts Analysis

**Current Location**: `extraction-system/scripts/extraction/`
- consolidation_template.py
- section_rdmap_template.py
- section_implicit_arguments_template.py

**Should these be in skill?**

**Skill-Creator Guidance on Scripts**:
- Include if: same code rewritten repeatedly OR deterministic reliability needed
- Include if: scripts are USED by Claude during extraction
- Exclude if: scripts are EXAMPLES/TEMPLATES for reference only

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **Current location is ACCEPTABLE but consider moving**

**Reasoning**:
- These are TEMPLATES, not executed scripts
- They're reference material showing proper structure
- Could be in `references/templates/` within skill for better discoverability
- Current location (outside skill) also acceptable since they're in extraction-system

**Recommendation**: Consider moving to `references/templates/` in future version for better skill cohesion, but current location is fine.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix README Issue ✅

**Action**: Remove references/README.md from skill
1. Merge useful content into extraction-system/skill/SKILL_README.md
2. Update SKILL_README.md to v2.6.3+ with recent improvements
3. Delete references/README.md from skill
4. Verify SKILL.md has adequate navigation (it does)

**Impact**: Minor fix, improves skill-creator compliance

### Priority 2: Update SKILL_README.md ✅

**Action**: Update extraction-system/skill/SKILL_README.md
- Current version: 2.6.1 (2025-10-25)
- Update to: 2.6.3+ (2025-10-27)
- Add: Implicit RDMAP improvements (consolidation + implicit extraction)
- Add: Implicit Arguments improvements (recognition patterns + common mistakes)
- Add: Template scripts documentation
- Merge: Useful content from references/README.md

**Impact**: Keeps archive documentation current

### Priority 3: Optional - Move Templates (Future)

**Action**: Consider moving template scripts to `references/templates/`
- consolidation_template.py
- section_rdmap_template.py
- section_implicit_arguments_template.py

**Rationale**:
- Templates are reference material (should be in skill)
- Better discoverability
- Skill self-contained

**Timing**: Not urgent, current location works

---

## Size Analysis

| File | Current Size | Guidelines | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| SKILL.md | 10 KB | <5k words (~20 KB) | ✅ Within limits |
| extraction-fundamentals.md | ~15 KB | Unlimited (reference) | ✅ Acceptable |
| consolidation-patterns.md | 25 KB | Unlimited (reference) | ✅ Acceptable |
| verification-procedures.md | 59 KB | Unlimited (reference) | ✅ Large but justified |
| Other references | 7-19 KB | Unlimited (reference) | ✅ Acceptable |

**Total Skill Size**: ~220 KB (uncompressed)

✅ **Assessment**: Size is appropriate for skill complexity

---

## User Concerns Addressed

### "Are files in root with SKILL.md?"

**Answer**: ❌ NO - All reference files properly in references/
- Only SKILL.md is in root (correct)
- User may have misremembered or was asking about references/README.md

### "Is README discouraged/disallowed?"

**Answer**: ✅ YES - Skill-creator guidance discourages READMEs
- README.md in references/ should be removed
- Content should be in SKILL.md or archive docs (SKILL_README.md)

### "Should references be in root or references/?"

**Answer**: ✅ Current placement is CORRECT
- All reference docs belong in references/
- SKILL.md provides navigation
- Progressive disclosure works properly

---

## Final Verdict

**Structure Grade**: A- (Excellent with minor fix needed)

**Strengths**:
- Exemplary file organisation
- Proper separation of concerns
- Excellent progressive disclosure
- Logical subdirectory structure
- Clean, discoverable reference organisation

**Issues**:
- references/README.md should not exist (minor)

**Actions**:
1. ✅ Merge references/README.md → SKILL_README.md
2. ✅ Update SKILL_README.md to v2.6.3+ with recent improvements
3. ✅ Delete references/README.md from skill
4. ✅ Copy updated skill to extraction-system/skill/research-assessor/
5. ✅ Git commit and push

After these actions, skill structure will be **perfect** per skill-creator guidelines.

---

## Conclusion

The research-assessor skill demonstrates excellent application of skill-creator principles. The only issue is a minor violation (references/README.md) that's easily fixed. File placement, organisation, and progressive disclosure are all exemplary.

**Post-Fix Status**: Will be 100% compliant with skill-creator best practices.
