# Planning Documents

This folder contains **active planning documents** for the LLM-based research extraction and assessment project.

**Project Status:**
âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: Extraction system development (v2.0 â†’ v2.5)
ðŸ“‹ **Phase 2 Upcoming**: Assessment framework development

---

## Active Planning Documents

These documents guide ongoing and future work:

### [CWTS Implementation Plan](cwts_implementation_plan.md)
**Status:** Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-3 upcoming
**Scope:** 6-month fellowship plan (Sept 2025 - Feb 2026)
**Focus:** LLM-based credibility assessment for humanities and social sciences

**Phases:**
- âœ… **Phase 1** (Months 1-2): Extraction prototype â†’ **COMPLETE**
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 2** (Months 3-4): Assessment framework development â†’ **UPCOMING**
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3** (Months 5-6): Validation and scaling â†’ **UPCOMING**

This is the master plan for the project, including:
- Strategic assets (local compute, domain expertise, repliCATS data access)
- Three-layer architecture (extraction, assessment, infrastructure)
- Validation approach and timeline

### [Implementation Plan Supplement](implementation_plan_supplement.md)
**Status:** Active guidance
**Focus:** Strategic decisions and constraints

Key topics:
- Copyright and access strategy (co-authored + OA papers)
- Multilingual development pathway (English first, then expansion)
- Community engagement plan (CAA-Australasia)

### [Schema Improvement Plan](schema_improvement_plan.md)
**Status:** Future work roadmap
**Focus:** Formalization and ontology alignment

Planned enhancements:
- Pragmatic iteration now, formalization later
- Crosswalk documentation to existing ontologies
- Empirically-driven taxonomy development
- Domain-specific vocabulary expansion

### [Preliminary Work](preliminary-work/)
Historical context documents:
- CWTS proposal
- Initial claims extraction concepts
