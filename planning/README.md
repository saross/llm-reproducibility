# Planning Documents

This folder contains **active planning documents** for the LLM-based research extraction and assessment project.

**Project Status:**
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Extraction system development (v2.0 → v2.6)
🚧 **Phase 2 In Progress**: Assessment framework development

## Active Planning Documents

### Master Plan

#### [credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md](credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md)
**Status:** Active master plan
**Focus:** Complete credibility assessment framework

This is the current authoritative plan, covering:
- Three Pillars Framework (Transparency → Credibility → Reproducibility)
- repliCATS Seven Signals adaptation for HASS
- Cluster-based assessment architecture
- Quality gating approach
- Implementation roadmap

### Active Working Documents

#### [active-todo-list.md](active-todo-list.md)
**Status:** Active
**Focus:** Current tasks and priorities

#### [fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md](fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md)
**Status:** Active
**Focus:** Controlled vocabulary development for extraction and assessment

### Fellowship Materials
