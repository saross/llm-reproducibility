# Regression Analysis: Chatbot extraction-02 vs Current CC v2.6.1

**Paper:** Sobotkova et al. 2023
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Purpose:** Assess regression from working chatbot extraction to current CC implementation
**Focus:** Research design granularity and protocol-method linking

---

## Executive Summary

**⚠️ TWO MAJOR REGRESSIONS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Research Design Extraction:** 5 items → 2 items (-60% regression)
   - Target was to INCREASE granularity, but decreased significantly
   - Lost 3 strategic design decisions

2. **Protocol-Method Linking:** 100% → 0% (complete failure)
   - Chatbot: 13/13 protocols properly linked
   - Current: 0/15 protocols linked
   - Root cause: Schema field rename (`implements_method` → `implements_methods`)

**✓ ONE SUCCESS:**
- Implicit Arguments improved sourcing quality (0% → 100% with trigger_text)
- Count decreased slightly (10 → 7), but quality vastly improved

**⚠️ OVERALL REGRESSION:**
- Total items: 139 → 112 (-27 items, -19.4%)
- Evidence: 46 → 33 (-28%)
- Claims: 60 → 46 (-23%)

## 1. Research Design Extraction - MAJOR REGRESSION ⚠️

**Target:** Increase granularity to capture more strategic design decisions (expected 3-6 items)
**Baseline (Chatbot):** 5 research designs
**Current:** 2 research designs
**Status:** ❌ FAILED - Regressed by 60%

### Chatbot Research Designs (5 items)

| ID | Type | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| RD001 | research_goal | Research goal framing |
| RD002 | study_design_choice | Study design decision |
| RD003 | study_design_choice | Study design decision |
| RD004 | study_design_choice | Study design decision |
| RD005 | study_design_choice | Study design decision |

**Note:** Chatbot extraction used granular categorization with 1 research_goal + 4 study_design_choice items.

### Current Research Designs (2 items)

| ID | Status | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| RD001 | explicit | Case study research design evaluating crowdsourced map digitization approach |
| RD002 | explicit | Comparative evaluation design to assess digitization approach efficiency thresholds |

**Note:** Current extraction consolidated into 2 high-level designs: case study + comparative evaluation.

### Analysis

**What was lost:**
- Chatbot extracted 5 distinct strategic decisions
- Current consolidated to 2 broad design frameworks
- Lost granularity in specific design choices (e.g., platform selection rationale, participant recruitment strategy, comparative baseline selection)

**Why this matters:**
- Research design granularity is critical for assessing whether design decisions are justified
- Each strategic decision requiring independent justification should be a separate RD item
- v2.6.1 prompt changes intended to INCREASE granularity but had opposite effect

**Root cause hypothesis:**
1. Prompts may emphasize consolidation too strongly
2. "Study design" framing may lead to holistic extraction rather than granular decisions
3. Lack of clear examples showing appropriate granularity level

---

## 2. Protocol → Method Linking - COMPLETE FAILURE ⚠️

**Target:** Maintain existing linking functionality
**Baseline (Chatbot):** 100% (13/13 protocols linked)
**Current:** 0% (0/15 protocols linked)
**Status:** ❌ COMPLETE REGRESSION

### Chatbot Protocol-Method Links (100% success)

**Field used:** `implements_method` (singular)

| Protocol | Linked Method | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| P001 | M001 | Map symbol identification → Feature identification method |
| P002 | M001 | Feature identification → Feature identification method |
| P003 | M002 | Training protocol → Crowdsourcing method |
| P004 | M002 | Participant onboarding → Crowdsourcing method |
| P005 | M002 | Volunteer management → Crowdsourcing method |
| P006 | M003 | Software evaluation → Platform selection method |
| P007 | M004 | FAIMS customization step 1 → Customization method |
| P008 | M004 | FAIMS customization step 2 → Customization method |
| P009 | M004 | FAIMS customization step 3 → Customization method |
| P011 | M004 | FAIMS customization step 5 → Customization method |
| P012 | M005 | Interface design → Interface design method |
| P014 | M006 | Time logging → Time-tracking method |
| P015 | M007 | Error assessment → Random sampling method |

**Success rate:** 13/13 protocols (100%) properly linked to implementing methods

### Current Protocol-Method Links (0% success)

**Field used:** `implements_methods` (plural, array)
**Result:** 0/15 protocols have this field populated

### Root Cause Analysis

**Schema field rename:**
- Chatbot schema: `implements_method` (string, singular)
- Current schema v2.5: `implements_methods` (array, plural)
- Prompts may still reference old field name, or lack guidance on populating new field

**Evidence:**
```json
// Chatbot (working)
{
  "protocol_id": "P001",
  "implements_method": "M001",  // ✓ Singular, string
  ...
}

// Current (broken)
{
  "protocol_id": "P001",
  "implements_methods": [],      // ✗ Plural, empty array
  ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot trace which protocols implement which methods
- Breaks RD → M → P traceability chain
- Prevents assessment of methodological coherence

## 3. Implicit Arguments - MIXED RESULT ⚠✓

**Baseline (Chatbot):** 10 implicit arguments (but 0% had trigger_text sourcing)
**Current:** 7 implicit arguments (100% have trigger_text sourcing)
**Status:** ✓ Quality improved, ⚠ Count decreased

### Comparison

| Metric | Chatbot | Current | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Count | 10 | 7 | -3 (-30%) |
| With trigger_text | 0 (0%) | 7 (100%) | +100% |
| Properly sourced | 0 | 7 | Massive improvement |

### Assessment

**Trade-off:**
- Lost 3 implicit arguments (30% decrease)
- BUT gained complete sourcing for all IAs (0% → 100%)

**Verdict:** Quality improvement outweighs count decrease. Current IAs are properly sourced and defensible, while chatbot IAs lacked hallucination protection.

## 4. Overall Item Count Regression

| Category | Chatbot | Current | Change | % Change |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Evidence | 46 | 33 | -13 | -28.3% |
| Claims | 60 | 46 | -14 | -23.3% |
| Implicit Arguments | 10 | 7 | -3 | -30.0% |
| Research Designs | 5 | 2 | -3 | -60.0% |
| Methods | 7 | 9 | +2 | +28.6% |
| Protocols | 13 | 15 | +2 | +15.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **141** | **112** | **-29** | **-20.6%** |

### Analysis

**Significant decreases:**
- Evidence: -28% (may reflect better consolidation)
- Claims: -23% (may reflect better consolidation)
- Research Designs: -60% (⚠️ REGRESSION - target was increase)

**Increases:**
- Methods: +29% (positive - better granularity)
- Protocols: +15% (positive - better granularity)

**Overall pattern:**
- RDMAP (methods/protocols) improved granularity
- Research Designs regressed severely
- Claims/Evidence decreased (could be appropriate consolidation)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Research Design Regression (5 → 2 items)

**Possible causes:**

1. **Schema confusion:** v2.5 schema has complex research_design_object with multiple conditional fields (research_framing, theoretical_framework, study_design, scope_definition, positionality). May lead to holistic extraction rather than granular.

2. **Prompt guidance insufficient:** Prompts may not provide clear examples of appropriate granularity level. v2.6.1 added "granularity principle" but may not be operationalized clearly enough.

3. **design_type enumeration too broad:** Current schema has:
   - `research_framing`
   - `theoretical_framework`
   - `study_design`
   - `scope_definition`
   - `positionality`

   Chatbot used:
   - `research_goal`
   - `study_design_choice`

   Chatbot's simpler taxonomy may have encouraged more granular extraction.

4. **Consolidation over-emphasis:** Pass 2/Pass 4 rationalization may be consolidating RDs that should remain separate.

### Protocol-Method Linking Regression (100% → 0%)

**Confirmed cause:** Schema field rename without prompt update

**Evidence:**
- Chatbot schema: `implements_method` (singular, string)
- Current schema v2.5: `implements_methods` (plural, array of strings)
- Prompts likely still reference old field or lack clear guidance on new field

**Fix required:**
1. Update all RDMAP prompts to reference `implements_methods` (plural)
2. Provide examples of array population: `"implements_methods": ["M001", "M002"]`
3. Add validation check for protocol-method linking in Pass 5

---

## Recommendations

### Critical Fixes (P0)

1. **Fix protocol-method linking** (REGRESSION)
   - Update prompts to use `implements_methods` (plural array)
   - Add examples showing array syntax
   - Add Pass 5 validation check: "All protocols should link to at least one method"

2. **Fix research design granularity** (REGRESSION)
   - Review and clarify granularity guidance in prompts
   - Add specific examples showing 3-6 RD items for similar papers
   - Consider restoring simpler design_type taxonomy (research_goal, study_design_choice)
   - Add Pass 4 quality check: "Papers typically have 3-6 research designs; if <3, verify granularity"

### High Priority (P1)

3. **Validate method extraction improvements**
   - Current has +2 methods vs chatbot (good)
   - Verify these aren't over-extractions

4. **Document sourcing improvements**
   - Current achieved 100% sourcing (vs chatbot's near-0%)
   - This is a MAJOR win - document in skill documentation

### Medium Priority (P2)

5. **Investigate claims/evidence decreases**
   - Evidence: 46 → 33 (-28%)
   - Claims: 60 → 46 (-23%)
   - May be appropriate consolidation, but verify no under-extraction
