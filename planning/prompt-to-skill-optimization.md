# Prompt-to-Skill Content Optimization Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Analyzer**: skill-creator skill assessment
**Context**: After Phase 1-3 refactoring, analyze prompts for remaining content that should move to skill

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: Prompts contain **~350 lines of conceptual/framework content** that should move to skill references.

**Key Skill-Creator Principle Applied**:
> "Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files."

**Findings**:
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: 3 duplications (~89 lines) - content exists in BOTH prompts AND skill
- ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH PRIORITY**: 8 conceptual frameworks (~263 lines) - belong in skill references, not prompts
- ðŸŸ¢ **OPTIONAL**: Pass-specific content that could be generalized (~50 lines)

**Estimated Impact**:
- Prompts: 2,426 â†’ ~2,070 lines (15% reduction)
- New skill references: +400 lines (organized, reusable)
- Reduced duplication, improved maintainability

## Part 1: Critical Duplications

### DUPLICATION 1: Evidence vs Claims Distinction

**Location 1**: SKILL.md lines 148-160 (13 lines)
**Location 2**: Prompt 01 lines 106-122 (17 lines)

**Assessment**: FULL DUPLICATION
- Both define Evidence vs Claims with same test
- Prompt 01 has slightly more detail (examples)
- **Violates**: "Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both"

**Recommendation**:
- Create `references/checklists/evidence-vs-claims-guide.md` (comprehensive version)
- Remove from SKILL.md (replace with pointer)
- Remove from Prompt 01 (replace with reference)

**Impact**: -30 lines total

---

### DUPLICATION 2: RDMAP Three-Tier Hierarchy (Decision Tree Form)

**Location 1**: tier-assignment-guide.md (full treatment, 193 lines)
**Location 2**: Prompt 03 lines 146-184 (39 lines)

**Assessment**: PARTIAL DUPLICATION
- tier-assignment-guide.md has comprehensive guidance
- Prompt 03 repeats basic decision tree and tier definitions
- Already removed from SKILL.md in Phase 1

**Recommendation**:
- Remove decision tree from Prompt 03
- Replace with: "See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` for decision tree"

**Impact**: -39 lines

---

### DUPLICATION 3: Tier Assignment Verification (in Pass 2)

**Location 1**: tier-assignment-guide.md (tier definitions)
**Location 2**: Prompt 04 lines 199-223 (25 lines)

**Assessment**: PARTIAL DUPLICATION
- Prompt 04 repeats tier indicators for verification
- tier-assignment-guide.md already has this

**Recommendation**:
- Remove tier definitions from Prompt 04
- Replace with reference to tier-assignment-guide.md
- Keep verification workflow instructions

**Impact**: -20 lines

## Part 7: Benefits Analysis

### For Prompts (Leaner, More Focused)

**Before Optimization:**
- Prompts contain mixture of workflow + conceptual frameworks
- Repeated concepts across prompts (duplication)
- Hard to update (change concept â†’ update multiple prompts)
- Context-heavy (2,426 lines total)

**After Optimization:**
- Prompts focus on workflow orchestration ("DO this, THEN that")
- Conceptual frameworks referenced, not repeated
- Easy to update (change concept â†’ update one reference file)
- Lighter context (2,113 lines total)

### For Skill (More Comprehensive, Reusable)

**Before Optimization:**
- Some frameworks missing from skill entirely
- Scattered knowledge (some in SKILL.md, some in prompts)
- Limited reusability

**After Optimization:**
- All decision frameworks centralized in skill
- Organized by topic (claims, consolidation, RDMAP, etc.)
- Reusable across passes and use cases
- Progressive disclosure works better

### For Maintenance

**Before Optimization:**
- Update framework â†’ find all prompt locations
- Risk of inconsistency
- Duplication between SKILL.md and prompts

**After Optimization:**
- Update framework â†’ edit one reference file
- Single source of truth
- Zero duplication

### For Users/Claude

**Before Optimization:**
- Must read full prompts to understand frameworks
- Frameworks buried in workflow instructions
- No central reference for "how do I decide X?"

**After Optimization:**
- Reference files provide comprehensive guidance
- Prompts provide workflow with pointers to details
- Clear separation: "what to do" (prompt) vs "how to decide" (skill)

---

## Part 8: Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Workflows

**Concern**: Removing content from prompts breaks extraction

**Mitigation**:
- Test with full extraction after each phase
- Keep prompts functional (replace removed content with clear references)
- Verify all references resolve correctly

### Risk 2: Over-Abstracting

**Concern**: Moving too much makes prompts too abstract

**Mitigation**:
- Keep workflow orchestration in prompts
- Move only conceptual/framework content
- Prompts remain self-contained for "what to do when"

### Risk 3: Increasing Context Load

**Concern**: More skill references â†’ more reading

**Mitigation**:
- Progressive disclosure: read only when uncertain
- Well-named files make it clear when to read
- Comprehensive table of contents in SKILL.md

---

## Part 9: Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (User Decision Needed)

1. **Review this analysis** - Confirm approach and priorities
2. **Approve Phase A** - Quick wins (critical duplications)
3. **Approve Phase B** - High-value moves (conceptual frameworks)
4. **Decide on Phase C** - Optional polish

### After Approval

1. **Implement Phase A** (1-2 hours)
   - Create evidence-vs-claims-guide.md
   - Remove duplications
   - Test

2. **Implement Phase B** (3-4 hours)
   - Create claims-hierarchy-guide.md
   - Enhance consolidation-patterns.md
   - Enhance tier-assignment-guide.md
   - Enhance research-design-operational-guide.md
   - Update all prompt references
   - Full extraction test

3. **Implement Phase C** (optional, 1 hour)
   - Add calculation claims pattern
   - Test

4. **Documentation**
   - Update SKILL_README.md with new reference files
   - Git commit with detailed message
   - Archive old prompts for reference

---

## Conclusion

The prompts currently contain **~313 lines of conceptual/framework content** that belongs in skill references according to skill-creator principles. Moving this content will:

- âœ… Eliminate 89 lines of duplication
- âœ… Reduce prompt size by 13% (2,426 â†’ 2,113 lines)
- âœ… Centralize decision frameworks in skill
- âœ… Improve maintainability (single source of truth)
- âœ… Better separation of concerns (workflow vs concepts)
- âœ… Enable reuse across passes

**Recommendation**: Implement Phases A and B (Priority 1 and 2) for maximum benefit with acceptable effort/risk ratio.
