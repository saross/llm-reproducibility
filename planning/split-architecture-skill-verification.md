# Split Architecture: Skill Reference Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Purpose:** Verify that the split architecture maintains proper skill invocation and references

---

## Skill Invocation Status

### ✅ Prompt 03 (RDMAP Pass 1 - Explicit)

**Skill Context Declaration:**
```markdown
**Skill Context:** This prompt is part of the research-assessor skill
```

**Skill Context:** This prompt is part of the research-assessor skill
```

**All references valid:** ✅ Yes

---

## Skill File Updates

### ✅ SKILL.md Updated

**Changes made:**

1. **Description metadata (line 3):**
   - Before: "five-pass iterative workflow"
   - After: "six-pass iterative workflow"

2. **Overview section (lines 15-19):**
   - Added explicit mention of all 6 passes:
     - Pass 3: RDMAP Explicit Extraction
     - Pass 4: RDMAP Implicit Extraction
     - Pass 5: RDMAP Rationalisation

3. **Workflow diagram (lines 37-53):**
   - Before: 5 passes (Claims 1/2, RDMAP 1/2, Validation 3)
   - After: 6 passes (Claims 1/2, RDMAP 3/4/5, Validation 6)

4. **Task identification (lines 76-82):**
   - Added separate entries for:
     - "Extract explicit RDMAP" → Pass 3
     - "Extract implicit RDMAP" → Pass 4
     - "Rationalise RDMAP" → Pass 5

5. **Prompt descriptions (lines 88-98):**
   - Separated RDMAP into three passes:
     - Pass 3: Explicit extraction
     - Pass 4: Implicit extraction
     - Pass 5: Rationalisation

**All updates complete:** ✅ Yes

## Reference Path Validation

## Reference Usage Patterns

### Prompt 03 (Explicit RDMAP)

**References critical skill files for explicit extraction:**
- `extraction-fundamentals.md` - Universal sourcing requirements (READ FIRST)
- `verbatim-quote-requirements.md` - Strict verbatim quote rules
- `verification-procedures.md` - Source verification procedures
- `tier-assignment-guide.md` - Design vs Method vs Protocol decisions
- `research-design-operational-guide.md` - Finding all research designs

**Appropriate for explicit extraction:** ✅ Yes - focuses on documentation scanning and tier assignment

---

### Prompt 04 (Implicit RDMAP)

**References critical skill files for implicit extraction:**
- `extraction-fundamentals.md` - Implicit RDMAP extraction patterns (Section reference)
- `schema/schema-guide.md` - Complete object definitions
- `tier-assignment-guide.md` - Tier classification for implicit items

**Appropriate for implicit extraction:** ✅ Yes - focuses on pattern recognition and inference

**Note:** Prompt 04 does NOT reference verbatim-quote-requirements.md because implicit items use trigger_text, not verbatim_quote. This is correct.

---

## Cross-Prompt Coordination

### Handoff Between Prompts 03 and 04

**Prompt 03 output expectations:**
- Explicit RDMAP items extracted with `*_status = "explicit"`
- All items have `verbatim_quote` populated
- extraction_notes documents: "RDMAP Pass 1: Explicit extraction complete. Implicit extraction pending (Pass 1b)."

**Prompt 04 input expectations:**
- Receives extraction.json with explicit RDMAP already populated
- Uses explicit items as "seed list" for implicit scanning
- Adds implicit items to same arrays with `*_status = "implicit"`

**Coordination mechanism:** ✅ Clear - extraction_notes signals completion, status field distinguishes types

---

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: Workflow Stage Numbering

**Prompt 03 header:**
```markdown
**Workflow Stage:** Pass 1 of 4 - Explicit RDMAP extraction (implicit extraction in Pass 1b)
```

**Prompt 04 header:**
```markdown
**Workflow Stage:** Pass 1b of 4 - Implicit RDMAP extraction following explicit extraction
```

**Potential confusion:** "Pass 1 of 4" vs "Pass 1b of 4" might suggest only 4 total passes when there are 6.

**Mitigation:** The WORKFLOW.md and SKILL.md clearly document 6 passes. The "1 of 4" refers to RDMAP workflow position (Pass 1, Pass 1b, Pass 2, Pass 3 = 4 RDMAP-related passes within 6 total).

**Action needed:** ✅ No change - numbering is accurate within RDMAP context

---

### Issue 2: Reference Path Resolution

**Both prompts use relative paths like:**
```markdown
`references/extraction-fundamentals.md`
```

**Resolution mechanism:** When research-assessor skill is active, paths resolve relative to skill root:
```
extraction-system/skill/research-assessor/references/extraction-fundamentals.md
```

**Verification:** All referenced files exist at expected paths ✅

**Action needed:** ✅ No change - paths resolve correctly when skill is active

---

## Testing Checklist

Before proceeding with split architecture test:

- [x] Prompt 03 declares skill context
- [x] Prompt 04 declares skill context
- [x] All Prompt 03 references valid
- [x] All Prompt 04 references valid
