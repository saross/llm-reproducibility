**Weak Mappings (4):**
- C019→E009, C089→E065, C093→E069, C105→E081
- Pattern: Evidence states facts but not interpretive conclusions

**Unmapped Claims (16):**
- Predominantly from Discussion/Conclusions sections
- Methodological recommendations and synthesis statements
- Pattern: Authorial synthesis vs empirical findings

### Key Findings

- **Perfect RDMAP hierarchy** - 100% strong mappings for methods and protocols
- **Strong quantitative support** - All major results claims have direct evidence
- **Section-based pattern** - Results near-perfect, Discussion/Conclusions has gaps
- **No systematic errors** - Issues isolated and correctable

## Comparison to Reference

**Reference:** sobotkova-et-al-2023 (same methodology)

| Metric | Ross 2009 | Sobotkova 2023 | Better |
|--------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Overall | 96.3% (A) | 95.8% (A) | Ross +0.5 |
| Pass A | 99.6% | 98.2% | Ross +1.4 |
| Pass B | 99.7% | 98.5% | Ross +1.2 |
| Pass C | 89.7% | 93.1% | Sobotkova +3.4 |
| ID issues | 2 | 5 | Ross -3 |
| Consolidations | 19 | 12 | Ross +7 |
| Claims mapped | 88.1% | 94.2% | Sobotkova +6.1% |

**Summary:** Ross extraction slightly higher quality (+0.5) with superior accuracy and granularity but lower mapping completeness.

## Recommendations

### Priority Fixes

**High Priority:**
1. **Map 16 unmapped Discussion/Conclusion claims** - Add evidence mappings for synthesis/recommendations (moderate effort)

**Medium Priority:**
2. **Correct C040→E022 mapping** - Fix topic mismatch (low effort)

**Low Priority:**
3. **Document C002, C026 ID gaps** - Add notes or remove gaps (low effort)
4. **Strengthen 4 weak mappings** - Add evidence for interpretive rationales (low-moderate effort)

### Methodological Recommendations

**For this extraction:**
- Add synthesis evidence type for claims synthesising multiple results
- Map recommendations to results they derive from
- Document interpretive leaps

**For future extractions:**
- Develop protocol for Discussion/Conclusion mapping
- Preserve Ross consolidation approach (aggressive but accurate)
- Preserve implicit protocol documentation approach (exemplary)

## Conclusion

### Overall: Excellent (A, 96.3%)

The Ross et al. 2009 extraction demonstrates **excellent quality** across all dimensions:

**Accuracy (99.6%, A):** Near-perfect extraction with zero hallucinations, accurate quantitative values, appropriate typing

**Granularity (99.7%, A):** Excellent consolidation (19 maintaining accuracy), no over-splitting, improved usability

**Mapping (89.7%, B+):** Perfect RDMAP hierarchy, strong quantitative support, with completeness gap in Discussion/Conclusions (88.1% claims mapped)

### Replication Readiness: High

Complete RDMAP framework, perfect evidence foundation, strong quantitative support, transparent implicit documentation enable full transparency and replicability assessment.

### Key Achievement

Demonstrates that **aggressive consolidation can maintain perfect accuracy while significantly improving usability** - important finding for extraction methodology.

### Primary Limitation

16 unmapped Discussion/Conclusions claims (11.9%) concentrated in synthesis/recommendations rather than empirical findings - represents methodological challenge rather than extraction failure.

### Comparative Standing

Slightly exceeds reference sobotkova-et-al-2023 assessment (96.3% vs 95.8%), demonstrating consistent high-quality extraction methodology.

### Final Grade: A (96.3/100)

**Rationale:** Excellent extraction quality with near-perfect accuracy and granularity, strong evidence mapping for empirical content, perfect RDMAP extraction, and only isolated correctable issues. Fully supports intended purpose of enabling transparency and replicability assessment.
