## Assessment Scope

**Total Items:** 288
- Evidence: 112
- Claims: 135
- Methods: 12
- Protocols: 25
- Research Designs: 4

## Methodology

This assessment uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Systematic sampling** (every 5th item) across all types
2. **Targeted checks** for high-risk categories (interpretive claims, complex consolidations, page references)
3. **Complete review** of RDMAP hierarchy relationships

## Evidence Assessment (112 items)

### Sample Review (E001, E006, E011, E016, E021, E026, E031, E036, E041, E046, E051, E056, E061, E066, E071, E076, E081, E086, E091, E096, E101, E106, E111)

#### E001 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "The study analysed approximately 100 square kilometres of QuickBird satellite imagery centred on L'Amastuola, Italy, in 2007 and 2008."
- **Verbatim:** "In 2007 and 2008, we analyzed ca. 100 sq km of imagery centered on L'Amastuola, Italy."
- **Page:** 423 ✓
- **Type:** quantitative_measurement ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate extraction, appropriate type

#### E006 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "Until recently, high-resolution multispectral imagery such as QuickBird has been used to analyze only relatively small areas."
- **Verbatim:** Matches with citations (Lasaponara and Masini 2007; Masini and Lasaponara 2006: 536-537)
- **Page:** 423 ✓
- **Type:** literature_observation ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate, proper literature attribution

#### E022 - MINOR ISSUE (Supporting Claim C040)
- **Content:** "QuickBird was the highest-resolution satellite imagery commercially available at project initiation"
- **Verbatim:** "At the time the project was initiated, QuickBird was the highest-resolution satellite imagery commercially available"
- **Issue:** E022 supports C040 which states "The existing body of settlement information from survey offered an ideal test case for remote sensing" - but E022 is about QuickBird resolution, not about survey data quality. This appears to be a **mapping error** (will flag in Pass C) rather than extraction error.
- **Page:** 425 ✓
- **Assessment:** Extraction accurate, mapping questionable

#### E034 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "Before georeferencing using ground control points, the image had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14 m."

- **Page:** 429 ✓
- **Type:** methodological_specification ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate, excellent type selection

#### E086 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "Overall, 14 out of 114 features (12.3%) identified and assessed yielded surface finds meeting the site density criterion."
- **Verbatim:** Exact match with calculation
- **Page:** 431 ✓
- **Type:** quantitative_result ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate extraction with proper calculation

#### E095 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "The discovery of 29 sites and off-site scatters exceeds the number expected from a randomly chosen area of equal size by more than three times."
- **Verbatim:** Exact match
- **Page:** 432 ✓
- **Type:** comparative_result ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate, key finding well-extracted

#### E105 - CORRECT (Complex consolidation)
- **Content:** Consolidates water percolation mechanism with archaeological interpretation
- **Verbatim:** Matches source describing clay layer water blocking
- **Page:** 435 ✓
- **Type:** hydrological_observation ✓
- **Assessment:** Excellent consolidation, accurate

- **Errors found:** 0
- **Mapping issues identified:** 1 (E022→C040)

## Claims Assessment (135 items)

### Sample Review (C001, C007, C013, C019, C025, C031, C037, C043, C049, C055, C061, C067 [MISSING], C073, C079, C085, C091, C097, C103 [MISSING], C109, C115, C121, C127, C133, C139, C145, C151 [MISSING])

#### C001 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "When deployed in combination with ground control, archaeological surface survey, and environmental research, remote sensing..."
- **Verbatim:** Exact match from p.423
- **Type:** methodological_assertion ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate extraction, appropriate type

#### C016 - MINOR PAGE ERROR POTENTIAL
- **Content:** "Only high-resolution multispectral imagery reveals the relatively small soil marks..."
- **Verbatim source:** Appears p.423 but listed supporting_evidence is E008 (literature gap about few combined projects)
- **Issue:** E008 doesn't directly support this capability claim. Appears to be **weak mapping** (Pass C issue)
- **Page:** 423 ✓
- **Assessment:** Extraction accurate, mapping weak

#### C018 - CORRECT
- **Content:** "The use of high-resolution multispectral imagery as a primary means of archaeological prospection is methodologically underdeveloped."
- **Verbatim:** Exact match
- **Page:** 423 ✓
- **Type:** methodological_critique ✓
- **Assessment:** Accurate

#### C022 - CONSOLIDATED (C018 RELATED)
- **Content:** "Many existing remote sensing studies fail to confirm identified sites through ground control..."
- **Verbatim:** References Madry 2007 example
- **Issue:** This is actually part of same methodological critique as C018. Could potentially have been consolidated, but acceptable as separate given specific example focus vs general statement.
- **Page:** 423 ✓
- **Assessment:** Acceptable granularity choice

#### C028 - MINOR DATA QUALITY
- **Content:** "The MTS provides a comparative dataset for the present remote sensing project."
- **Supporting evidence:** Lists E011, E012
- **Verbatim:** States "The MTS provides a comparative dataset" (p.424)
- **Issue:** C028 and C008 are very similar - both about MTS providing comparative data. C008 focuses on "independent definitions" while C028 states "comparative dataset." These could have been consolidated but acceptable distinction.
- **Assessment:** Marginal but acceptable granularity

#### C034 - INTERPRETIVE CONCERN
- **Content:** "The site's location on a prominent hilltop was selected with strategic or visibility considerations."
- **Verbatim:** "Setting aside the historical debate, the site occupies one of the most prominent hill peaks... Apart from its dominant location"
- **Issue:** Source describes topographic fact ("occupies") but claim asserts ancient intentionality ("was selected with"). This is authorial interpretation, not stated in text. Should note claim_type should perhaps indicate this interpretive leap.

### Claim ID Sequence Check
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** Gap analysis reveals missing IDs:
- C002 - MISSING
- C026 - MISSING
- C067 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C066 references it - CORRECT)
- C071 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C069 references it - CORRECT)
- C083 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C049 references it - CORRECT)
- C098 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C097 references it - CORRECT)
- C103 - MISSING
- C111 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C108 references it - CORRECT)
- C113 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C110 references it - CORRECT)
- C116 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C115 references it - CORRECT)
- C138 - MISSING (but consolidation note in C134 references it - CORRECT)

- Actual claim count: 135 extracted, but gaps suggest original pass may have had 151 before consolidations
- 16 consolidations documented in notes ✓

**DATA QUALITY ISSUE:** C002 and C026 missing without explanation
