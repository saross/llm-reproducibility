### Claim → Evidence Mapping Summary

**Total mappings verified:** 89

**Mapping Quality Results:**

**Strong mappings:** 88
- All major claims appropriately supported by direct measurements, observations, or calculations
- Evidence clearly demonstrates or directly measures the claimed phenomena
- Verbatim quotes or quantitative data align with claim assertions

**Weak mappings:** 1
- **C044 → E041**: "Low attrition indicated satisfaction" supports volunteer satisfaction, but only indirectly supports claim that "volunteers could attain and maintain high digitisation rate"
  - E055 provides strong support for C044, making this weak link non-critical
  - Attrition relates to satisfaction/retention, not directly to digitisation velocity

**Incorrect mappings:** 0

**Claim→Evidence Mapping Score: 98.9%** (88 strong / 89 total)

**Assessment:** Claim-evidence mapping is excellent. Only 1 weak link identified, and that claim (C044) has alternative strong evidence support (E055). No incorrect mappings found.
