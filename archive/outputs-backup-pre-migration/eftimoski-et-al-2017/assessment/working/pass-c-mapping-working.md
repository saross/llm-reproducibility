# Pass C: Mapping Assessment - eftimoski-et-al-2017

## Assessment Metadata

- **Assessment Date:** 2025-11-02
- **Assessor:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Total Mappings:** 132 (48 claim→evidence, 84 claim→claim, 4 method→design, 10 protocol→method)

## Mapping Quality Criteria

**Strong Mapping:** Evidence/method/design directly supports claim with appropriate specificity and relevance

**Weak Mapping:** Tenuous or indirect connection; evidence supports claim but relationship strained

**Incorrect Mapping:** Evidence does not support claim, or relationship type wrong
