# Pass B: Granularity Assessment - Ross (2005)

## Assessment Scope
- **Total Items**: 120 (17 evidence, 78 claims, 9 methods, 12 protocols, 4 designs)
- **Assessment Date**: 2025-11-02
- **Assessor**: Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Scoring Framework
- **Appropriate**: Item correctly scoped - neither over-split nor under-split
- **Over-split**: Single atomic unit split into multiple items unnecessarily
- **Under-split**: Multiple distinct units combined inappropriately
- **Inconsistent**: Granularity level inconsistent with similar items

---

## Evidence Granularity Assessment (17 items)

### Overall Principle
Evidence items should represent atomic textual citations that directly support claims. Each citation should be:
- Self-contained enough to verify independently
- Distinct enough to justify separate extraction
- Consolidated enough to avoid fragmentation

### E001-E005: Primary Iliad/Odyssey/Herodotus citations
- **E001 (Hdt. 8.144)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Single Herodotus passage, complete thought
- **E002 (Il. 2.802-6)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Hektor's command passage, complete unit (4 lines)
- **E003 (Il. 2.867-69)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Nastes/Karians passage, complete unit (3 lines)
- **E004 (Il. 4.433-38)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Trojan battle cry passage, complete unit (6 lines)
- **E005 (Od. 19.172-77)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Kretan diversity passage, complete unit (6 lines)

**Assessment**: All five primary citations are appropriately scoped. Line ranges capture complete thoughts without over-extraction.

### E006-E010: Shorter citations and parallels
- **E006 (Od. 14.229-31, 240-42)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Two non-consecutive passages providing context for E005, correctly consolidated as single evidence item since they serve single evidentiary function (establishing Odysseus/Aithon as Akhaian)
- **E008 (Il. 1.403-4)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Divine/human naming exemplar (2 lines)
- **E009 (Il. 20.74)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Parallel to E008, brief citation appropriate
- **E010 (Od. 10.305)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Another parallel, brief citation appropriate
- **E015 (Il. 2.668)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Single-line oblique reference, correctly extracted separately as tentative evidence

**Assessment**: Shorter citations appropriately atomic. E006 consolidation (two non-consecutive passages) justified by single evidentiary function. E009 and E010 could theoretically be consolidated with E008 into "Examples of divine/human naming differences," but separate extraction is defensible since each represents distinct textual location and C048 explicitly discusses the pattern ("The difference between human and divine speech is echoed elsewhere...").

**Granularity Decision**: E008/E009/E010 separation appropriate for citation precision.

### E011-E014: Homeric Hymns evidence
- **E011 (Hymn Ap. 156-64)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Delian maidens passage, unique significance
- **E012 (Hymn Ven. 111-16)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Aphrodite language explanation
- **E013 (Hymn Cer. 118-44)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Demeter counterexample (26 lines appropriate for extended passage)
- **E014 (Hymn Bacch. 53-57)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Dionysus counterexample

**Assessment**: E013 and E014 both serve as counterexamples (gods communicating without language barriers) but extracted separately because:
1. Different texts (Hymn to Demeter vs Hymn to Bacchus)
2. Different narrative contexts
3. Separate citation locations

**Granularity Decision**: Separation appropriate for scholarly precision.

### E016-E017: RUN-02 additions
- **E016 (Il. 2.862-63)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Phrygian remoteness marker
- **E017 (Il. 3.181-90)**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Priam-Otreus connection

**Assessment**: Both added in comprehensive scan (RUN-02). Neither has claim mappings but serve thematic support. Appropriate separate extraction since they represent distinct textual moments and geographic/temporal connections.

## Claims Granularity Assessment (78 items)

### Framework Claims (C001-C027)

#### Problem Statement Cluster (C001-C003)
- **C001** (disagreement): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Contextualisation claim
- **C002** (Classical consensus): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Scholarly consensus claim
- **C003** (proto-Panhellenism debate): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Problem statement

**Assessment**: Three-claim structure appropriately segments: (1) general disagreement, (2) agreed endpoint, (3) debated origins. Could theoretically consolidate into single "scholarly context" claim, but separation provides clearer argument structure.

#### Methodological Claims (C004)
- **C004**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Core methodological claim (examining language in Iliad to illuminate identity)

#### Pattern Identification Claims (C005-C014)
- **C005** (rarely acknowledged): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C088)
- **C006** (consistent pattern): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C076, C089)
- **C007** (free communication): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C090)
- **C008** (no hard line): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C091)
- **C009** (dichotomy absent): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C092, C080)
- **C010** (diversity limited to Trojans): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C094)
- **C011** (absent from Akhaians): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C095, C060)
- **C012** (differential treatment): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C096)
- **C013** (coalescing identity): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C098, C063)
- **C014** (proto-Panhellenism glimpse): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C079, C062, C081)

**Assessment**: Strong consolidation from Pass 2 rationalisation. C007/C008 could theoretically merge further (both describe lack of hard linguistic division), but separation is defensible:
- C007: Empirical observation (free communication)
- C008: Analytical interpretation (no dividing line)

**Granularity Decision**: Separation appropriate for distinguishing observation from interpretation.

#### Dating Framework Claims (C015-C027)
- **C015-C017**: Dating difficulties and controversies (3 claims)
- **C018-C022**: Ross's dating position and justification (5 claims)
- **C023-C027**: Oral tradition theory rationale (5 claims)

**Assessment**: 13 claims for dating/methodology framework might seem granular, but each represents distinct component:
- Dating problems vs. solutions vs. implications
- Linguistic evidence vs. Nagy's theory vs. oral tradition dynamics
- Physical vs. abstract information preservation

**Granularity Decision**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Methodological framework requires this level of detail for transparency about dating assumptions.

---

### Core Analysis Claims (C028-C054)

#### Textual Analysis Claims
- **C030** (Il. 2.802-6 addresses organisation): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C031** (barbarophonos interpretation): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C057)
- **C032** (language mentioned once): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C059)
- **C033** (diversity pattern): ✓ APPROPRIATE - After consolidation (merged C066, C093)

**Assessment**: Core textual analysis claims appropriately atomic. C033 is key synthetic claim (emphasised among Trojans, absent among Akhaians) supported by E002, E003, E004. Could theoretically split into two claims (Trojan emphasis + Akhaian absence), but current consolidation better reflects unified interpretive observation.

#### Comparative Claims (C040-C054)
- **C040-C044**: Od. 19 Kretan diversity analysis (5 claims)
- **C045-C047**: Hesiod comparison (3 claims)
- **C048**: Divine/human naming (1 claim)
- **C049-C050**: Hymn to Delian Apollo (2 claims)
- **C051-C053**: Hymn to Aphrodite analysis (3 claims)
- **C054**: Dorian reference (1 claim)

**Assessment**: 15 claims for comparative analysis section. Granularity appropriate:
- Each text gets dedicated claim cluster
- Within-text claims distinguish description, interpretation, significance
- No unnecessary fragmentation

**Example - C049/C050 pair**:
- C049: Uniqueness claim (only generic human diversity instance)
- C050: Interpretive claim (transcendence of divine speech)

**Granularity Decision**: ✓ APPROPRIATE - Could consolidate into single claim but separation clarifies descriptive vs. interpretive distinction.

---

### Supporting Claims (C055-C100)

#### Definitional/Geographic Claims (C055, C058)
- **C055** (epikouroi definition): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Necessary clarification of key term
- **C058** (Karians location): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Geographic context

**Assessment**: Both provide essential contextual information. Not over-splitting.

#### Contrastive/Comparative Claims (C061, C064, C078, C097)
- **C061** (uniformity vs. cacophony): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Contrastive pattern
- **C064** (no barrier paradox): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Paradox observation distinct from C007/C008
- **C078** (battle cry contrast): ✓ APPROPRIATE - Implied contrast to Akhaian silence
- **C097** (pan-Akhaian vs. cacophony): Potential duplicate of C061/C012

**Potential Issue**: C097 "Pan-Akhaian uniformity distinct from Trojan host cacophony" appears to overlap with:
- C061: "Linguistic uniformity among Akhaians contrasts with Trojan cacophony"
- C012: "Differential treatment reveals pan-Akhaian linguistic uniformity"

**Examination**:
- C012: Analytical claim (differential treatment reveals uniformity)
- C061: Contrastive claim (uniformity vs. cacophony)
- C097: Contrastive characterisation (uniformity distinct from cacophony)

**Assessment**: C061 and C097 are very similar. However, checking verbatim quotes:
- C061: "distinct from the cacophony of the Trojan host"
- C097: "distinct from the cacophony of the Trojan host"

Same verbatim text. **This suggests C097 might be residual from pre-consolidation.**

**Granularity Decision**: ⚠️ **Possible minor over-retention** - C097 appears to duplicate C061. However, both survive Pass 2 consolidation, suggesting they may serve different argumentative functions in context. Would need to check if related_claims differ.

Checking extraction:
- C061 related_claims: [C012, C060]
- C097 related_claims: [C012, C061]

C097 explicitly relates to C061, suggesting it may have been retained as derivative claim. **Borderline case but defensible.**

#### Enumeration Claims (C077, C082-C084)
- **C077** (three main Iliad passages): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C082** (Odyssey once): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C083** (Hesiod once): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C084** (Hymns twice): ✓ APPROPRIATE

**Assessment**: Frequency enumerations appropriately extracted. These are factual observations that support pattern analysis.

#### Analytical Claims (C085-C087, C099-C100)
- **C085** (focusing on diversity illuminates identity): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C086** (Iliad as literary source): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C087** (language component of Panhellenism): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C099** (non-oppositional identity): ✓ APPROPRIATE
- **C100** (selective recognition offers glimpse): ✓ APPROPRIATE

**Assessment**: All appropriately scoped analytical claims. No over-splitting.
