Using this system, our upload speeds consistently averaged 25 Kbps—too slow for syncing, even when tablets were left to do so overnight. [I] then attempted to sync tablets on weekend trips to a city located one hour's drive away from Zaña. However, the large numbers of photographs we were attaching to our data records made complete syncs impossible. In the end, the FAIMS development team adjusted the PAZC module to allow syncing of our textual data alone, and we manually backed up all photographs onto external hard drives.",
