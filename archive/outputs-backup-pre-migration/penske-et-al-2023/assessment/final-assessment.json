    "fitness_for_use": "NOT SUITABLE for replicability assessment without major corrections. While content quality is excellent (A- accuracy, A granularity), bidirectional mapping inconsistencies create fundamental data integrity problems. The extraction requires systematic mapping reconciliation across all relationship types, particularly complete rebuild of protocol-method mappings (0% consistency) and significant repairs to method-design (47% consistency) and claim-evidence (80% consistency) mappings. Estimated correction effort: HIGH (62+ bidirectional inconsistencies plus systematic protocol-method rebuild required).",

- 4 hours: Fix 7 missing item references
- 20-30 hours: Rebuild protocol-method mappings (0% consistency)

- 6-8 hours: Reconcile claim-evidence mappings (20 issues)
- 2-4 hours: Address accuracy refinements
- 4-6 hours: Verification and validation"
