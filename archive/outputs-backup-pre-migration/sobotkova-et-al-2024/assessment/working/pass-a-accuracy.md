- Verbatim: "false negative rates were 95–96%"
- Location: Abstract, Findings, para 1
- ✅ **CORRECT** - Quote verified, rates accurate, location correct

**E002**: "False positive rates were 87-95% of tagged tiles"
- Verbatim: "false positive rates were 87–95% of tagged tiles"
- Location: Abstract, Findings, para 1
- ✅ **CORRECT** - Quote verified, rates accurate, location correct

**E003**: "True positives were only 5-13% of tagged tiles"
- Verbatim: "true positives were only 5–13%"
- Location: Abstract, Findings, para 1
- ✅ **CORRECT** - Quote verified, percentage accurate

**E004**: "Model development required approximately 135 person-hours of work"
- Verbatim: "Development of the model, meanwhile, required approximately 135 person-hours of work."
- Location: Abstract, Findings, para 1
- ✅ **CORRECT** - Quote verified, measurement accurate, uncertainty_declared: true is appropriate

**E005**: "Model provided with training data for highly visible mounds performed worse than model with all mounds"
- Verbatim: "Counterintuitively, the model provided with training data selected for highly visible mounds (rather than all mounds) performed worse."
- Location: Abstract, Findings, para 1
