## Pass C: Mapping Assessment

### Overall: 100% (A)

**Mappings Assessed:** 28
**Strong Mappings:** 28
**Weak Mappings:** 0
**Incorrect Mappings:** 0

### Mapping Quality by Relationship Type

| Relationship Type | Total | Strong | Weak | Incorrect | Score |
|-------------------|-------|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Claim → Evidence** | 28 | 28 | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| **Method → Design** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A* |
| **Protocol → Method** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A* |

*RDMAP relationships implicit but inferable. Appropriate for methodological paper discussing RDMAP conceptually rather than applying it empirically.

### Claim→Evidence Mapping Analysis

**Coverage Statistics:**
- Claims with Evidence Links: 23/99 (23.2%)
- Total Evidence Link Mappings: 28
- Average Links per Linked Claim: 1.22

**Coverage Assessment:** ✅ **APPROPRIATE FOR PAPER TYPE**
- This is a methodological/conceptual paper, not an empirical study
- 23.2% coverage appropriate (vs 122% typical for empirical papers)
- Many claims are definitional, methodological, procedural, or argumentative
- Evidence links primarily for empirical, historical, and case study claims

### Evidence Utilisation Analysis

| Evidence ID | Times Used | Supporting Claims |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **E001** | 2 | C001, C108 (Reproducibility crisis) |
| **E002** | 2 | C023, C025 (HARKing prevalence) |
| **E005** | 3 | C027, C028, C101 (Hole 1973 critique) |
| **E006** | 2 | C028, C029 (French 1973 observation) |
| **E009** | 3 | C036, C043, C081 (FAIMS scope) |
| **E010** | 5 | C036, C037, C038, C040, C043 (FAIMS under-investment findings) |

| **E014** | 1 | C096_consolidated (Ocean Health Index problem) |
| **E015** | 2 | C099, C100 (Ocean Health Index solution) |

**Unused Evidence:** E003, E004, E007, E008 (4 items, 26.7%)
**Assessment:** ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Contextual/background evidence establishing disciplinary/historical context. Not all evidence requires explicit claim linkage in methodological/conceptual papers.

### Mapping Patterns Identified

**Pattern 1: Evidence Reuse**
Single evidence → multiple claims
*Examples:* E010→5 claims, E012→5 claims
*Assessment:* ✅ Appropriate - general finding supports specific elaborations

**Pattern 2: Evidence Synthesis**
Multiple evidence → single claim
*Examples:* C028→E005+E006, C066→E011+E012
*Assessment:* ✅ Appropriate - complex claims require multiple evidence points

**Pattern 3: Evidence Chains**
Logical progression of related evidence
*Example:* OSF registry chain: E011 (search) → E012 (characterisation) → E013 (quality)
*Assessment:* ✅ Strong logical progression

**Pattern 4: Case Study Pairing**
Problem-solution evidence pairs
*Example:* Ocean Health Index: E014 (problem) + E015 (solution)
*Assessment:* ✅ Well-structured problem-solution evidence

**Pattern 5: Historical Evidence**
Multiple historical sources for precedent
*Example:* 1970s processual: E005 (Hole), E006 (French), E007 (French provenance)
*Assessment:* ✅ Appropriate historical precedent establishment

### Key Findings

✅ **Perfect mapping quality** - All 28 claim-evidence mappings are strong
✅ **No incorrect mappings** - All evidence appropriately supports linked claims
✅ **No weak mappings** - All relationships direct and clear
✅ **Appropriate evidence reuse** - Single evidence points appropriately support multiple related claims
✅ **Sophisticated evidence synthesis** - Multiple evidence points appropriately combined for complex claims
✅ **Evidence chain structure** - Logical progression in OSF registry evidence
✅ **Case study pairing** - Problem-solution evidence pairs well-structured
✅ **Appropriate coverage** - 23.2% claim-evidence coverage appropriate for methodological paper
