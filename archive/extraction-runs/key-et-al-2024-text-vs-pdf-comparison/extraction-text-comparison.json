The RDMAP extraction from Passes 3-4 was already at appropriate granularity because the paper documents distinct, well-defined methodological components. This is expected for methods validation papers where each procedure has independent assessment value. Zero reduction is appropriate when original extraction was correctly granular rather than over-extracted."
