     # Pipeline Improvement Notes
     **Purpose:** Track observations, problems, and successes from
     variability testing to inform potential pipeline refinements.
     **Protocol:** Update after each paper completes 5 runs. Make decisions
     about improvements only after sufficient data (all 5 papers).
     **Last Updated:** 2025-12-02

● Created the pipeline improvement planning document at
  outputs/variability-test/pipeline-improvement-notes.md.

  Document Structure:

  - Summary Statistics: Table tracking variability metrics across all papers
  - Paper 1 (Sobotkova): Problems (claims/evidence granularity), successes
  (RDMAP stability, assessment consistency), mitigations
  - Paper 2 (Penske): Problems (protocol variability CV 27.2%,
  reproducibility signal range), successes (implicit args stability, verdict
   consistency), mitigations
  - Cross-Paper Observations: Patterns that hold across both papers
  - Proposed Mitigation Strategies:
    - Strategy A: Prompt refinement (low risk)
    - Strategy B: Multi-run voting 2-of-3 (medium risk)
    - Strategy C: Staged pipeline with quality gates (medium risk)
    - Strategy D: Accept current variability (no risk)
  - Decision Log: Track decisions as testing progresses
  - Next Steps: Continue with Papers 3-5 before implementing changes

  Key Insight: Assessment stability (1-2% CV) far exceeds extraction
  variability (7-27% CV). The pipeline produces consistent verdicts despite
  extraction differences—this is a strength worth preserving.

> that is a good observation, leading me to favour only low risk changes at 
most. First, though, let's evaluate the other papers. If you're ready and
clear context after this message and we'll start fresh.

● Ready. The queue is set to ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 run-01
  (methodological paper about FAIMS Mobile). After context clear, run
  /variability-run to continue.
