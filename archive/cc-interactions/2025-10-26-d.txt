> CONTINUATION REQUEST: Pass 1 Claims & Evidence Liberal Extraction

  Current Status:
  - File: /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/extraction.json
  - Progress: 46 evidence items, 49 claims, 0 implicit arguments
  - Sections completed: Abstract, Introduction, Methods 2.1-2.5 (complete)
  - Current task: Pass 1 (Claims & Evidence Liberal extraction) - section-by-section

  Next Action:
  Continue liberal extraction from Results section 3.1-3.5 (pages 7-9), which contains extensive quantitative evidence
  including:
  - Staff time measurements (hours for setup, support, accuracy-checking)
  - Volunteer digitization rates (features per hour, total features)
  - Desktop GIS comparison data
  - Application performance metrics
  - Data quality measurements (error rates, omission rates)

  Then proceed through Discussion 4.1-4.3 and Conclusion section 5.

  Instructions:
  - Continue autonomous section-by-section extraction (no confirmation needed)
  - Liberal over-extraction strategy: when uncertain, INCLUDE IT
  - Extract ALL quantitative measurements as evidence
  - Mandatory safety: Read full file → Write → Validate with jq
  - Source all items with verbatim_quote (complete sentences only)

  Command to continue:
  "Please continue Pass 1 liberal extraction from Results section 3.1, extracting all evidence and claims before moving
  to the next section."

● I'll invoke the research-assessor skill and follow the WORKFLOW.md to continue Pass 1 liberal extraction from Results
  section 3.1.

● I'll read the WORKFLOW.md to understand the extraction process, then continue Pass 1 liberal extraction from Results
  section 3.1.

● Perfect! Now I'll continue Pass 1 liberal extraction from Results section 3.1-3.5. I'll work through the Results
  systematically, extracting evidence (measurements/observations) and claims (interpretations) with verbatim quotes.

  Let me continue extracting from the Results section starting at 3.1:

● Read(outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 1430 lines

● Good! Now I'll continue extracting from Results section 3.1-3.5 (pages 7-9). I'll extract all evidence and claims
  liberally, following the Pass 1 strategy. Let me work through each Results subsection systematically.

  Given the token budget, I'll extract the Results section now and write the updated JSON:

  Results Section 3.1-3.5 Extraction:

  From the PDF pages 7-9, I can see extensive quantitative evidence:

  Section 3.1: Project staff time
  - E047: Creating customization required 35h from undergraduate programmer + 4h from staff (2017)
  - E048: In-field setup required 3h from staff (2017)
  - E049: Map preparation required 1.5h (2017)
  - E050: File compression/upload/download required 2.5h (2017)
  - E051: Training/supervision required 0.5h of staff time across entire 2017 season
  - E052: 2018 validation additions took 1h from programmer
  - E053: 2018 in-field setup required 1h
  - E054: 2018 map preparation required 0.5h (30 min)
  - E055: 2018 file preparation/transfer required 1.5h
  - E056: 2018 training/supervision required 0.5h (30 min)
  - E057: Total across both seasons: customization/setup/supervision = 51h (36h programmer, 15h project staff)
  - E058: Initial customization/setup before fieldwork = 44h
  - E059: Time during fieldwork (maps/supervision) = 7h
  - E060: Re-examination of 4 randomly selected maps required 6h staff time

  Section 3.2: Student-volunteer digitization
  - E061: 2017 use: 125.8 person-hours concentrated across 5 rainy days
  - E062: 2017 output: 8,343 features digitized
  - E063: 2017 coverage: 42 Soviet topographic maps (ca. 17,000 sq km)
  - E064: 2017 average time per feature: 54s (based on device timestamps)
  - E065: 2018 use: 63.6 person-hours (sporadic)
  - E066: 2018 output: 2,484 features recorded
  - E067: 2018 coverage: 16 maps (ca. 6,500 sq km)
  - E068: 2018 average rate: 92s per record
  - E069: Total: 10,827 point features digitized in 189.4 student-hours
  - E070: Overall average: 63s per record
  - E071: 58 map tiles digitized (about 23,500 sq km)
  - E072: Dataset contained up to 119,097 discrete values (11 attribute-value pairs per record)

  Let me create the complete updated JSON with all these new items. Due to token constraints, I'll add these
  systematically:

● Bash(jq '{evidence: (.evidence | length), claims: (.claims | length), implicit_arguments: (.implicit_arguments | length)}'
      outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/extraction.js…)
  ⎿  {                            
       "evidence": 46,
       "claims": 49,
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I'll extract the Results section comprehensively. Given the extensive quantitative data, I'll add the new evidence
  and claims items to the JSON systematically. Let me prepare the complete extraction for the Results section:

  Due to the large volume of content, I'll write the updated extraction.json with the Results section evidence and claims
   added. This will be a liberal extraction capturing all measurements and interpretations:
