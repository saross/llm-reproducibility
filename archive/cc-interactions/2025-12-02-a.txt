> Hi CC, welcome back, can you please look in 
archive/cc-interactions/2025-12-01-e.txt and remind me where we left off? I
think we needed to to variability-check extraction runs across paper #2, but
 I'd like to confirm.

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-12-01-e.txt)
  ⎿  Read 291 lines

● Based on the archive, we completed run-01 of Paper 2 (penske-et-al-2023)
  with a full 10-pass extraction + assessment:

  Run-01 Results:
  - 199 total items extracted (67 evidence, 60 claims, 19 methods, etc.)
  - Credibility verdict: GOOD (77/100)
  - Cluster ratings: C1 Strong, C2 Strong, C3 Adequate

  Queue Status at End of Session:
  - Completed: 6/25 runs (Paper 1: 5 runs, Paper 2: 1 run)
  - Next up: penske-et-al-2023/run-02

  You're correct — we need to complete runs 02-05 for Paper 2 to finish its
  variability testing. Let me check the current queue state to confirm:

● Read(input/variability-queue.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 132 lines

● Confirmed! The queue shows:

  Paper 2 (penske-et-al-2023) Status:
  - ✅ run-01: completed (67 evidence, 60 claims, score 77)
  - ⏳ run-02: pending ← next up
  - ⏳ run-03: pending
  - ⏳ run-04: pending
  - ⏳ run-05: pending

  Overall Progress: 6/25 runs complete (Paper 1 done, Paper 2 needs 4 more)

  Would you like me to proceed with run-02 of penske-et-al-2023?

> I'll clear context before we do the run, we were going to be careful about
 doing so. But first, can you remind me what the slash-command for doing the
 variability run is? Is it /variability-run?

● Let me check what slash commands are available:

● Search(pattern: "**/.claude/commands/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Yes, it's /variability-run. Let me confirm what it does:

● Read(.claude/commands/variability-run.md)
  ⎿  Read 53 lines

● Correct — it's /variability-run

  The command does the full pipeline:
  1. Reads queue to find next pending run (currently run-02)
  2. Loads research-assessor skill
  3. Creates output directory
  4. Executes Passes 0-7 (extraction) + Passes 8-10 (assessment)
  5. Updates queue with results
  6. Runs validation script
  7. Reports completion

  Key point from the command: "This is a FRESH extraction - do not reference
   any previous runs" — which is why clearing context before each run is
  important for the variability test.

  Go ahead and /clear, then run /variability-run in the fresh session.
