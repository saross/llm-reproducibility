  FAIMS software co-development.

  Pass 0: Planning and Initialisation

  Paper Analysis

  Paper: Sobotkova et al. 2016 - "Measure Twice, Cut Once: Cooperative
  Deployment of a Generalized, Archaeology-Specific Field Data Collection
  System"

  Paper Type: Methodological (software/platform paper with case studies)
  Research Approach: Inductive (deriving lessons from deployment
  experiences)
  Length: ~35 pages (253 lines in markdown, substantial content)
  Context Flags: 📦 (software tool paper)

  Section Structure Analysis

  Based on the paper structure, I'll define 7 section groups for extraction:

  | Section                                      | Content
                                     | Est. Words | Pages |
  |----------------------------------------------|--------------------------
  -----------------------------------|------------|-------|
  | 1. Abstract + Introduction                   | Context, opening quote,
  digital archaeology choices         | ~1200      | 1-2   |
  | 2. FAIMS Project + Platform                  | Project history, funding,
   sustainability, platform features | ~1400      | 2-3   |
  | 3. Customisation + Between Off-the-Shelf     | How to customise,
  spectrum of software approaches           | ~1500      | 3-4   |
  | 4. Co-Development + Case Studies Intro       | Nature of co-development,
   three case study introductions    | ~1200      | 4-5   |
  | 5. Theme 1: Upfront Costs                    | Scoping, development,
  testing, payoff                       | ~1500      | 5-7   |
  | 6. Theme 2-3: Trade-offs + Digital Recording | Legacy features, servers,
   interpretation benefits           | ~1400      | 7-8   |
  | 7. Conclusions + Acknowledgments             | Summary, lessons, funding
   acknowledgments                   | ~800       | 8-9   |

  Extraction Approach:
  - Pass 1: Liberal extraction - 40-50% over-extraction expected
  - Pass 3: SAME sections as Pass 1, equal attention to ALL sections
  (research designs in Introduction, Case Studies, Discussion, Conclusions)
  - ESPECIALLY liberal with research designs (commonly under-extracted in
  methodological papers)

  Item Targets (Methodological Paper):
  - Evidence: 25-45 items (case study examples, deployment statistics, time
  savings)
  - Claims: 45-70 items (methodological arguments, prescriptive assertions,
  lessons learned)
  - Implicit Arguments: 8-15 items (assumptions about software development,
  fieldwork practices)
  - Research Designs: 4-7 items (evaluation framework, case study design,
  co-development model)
  - Methods: 6-12 items (software customisation, deployment, data
  collection)
  - Protocols: 8-18 items (development procedures, testing protocols,
  support processes)

  Let me create the output directory and initialise extraction.json:

● Now let me extract the metadata from the paper (Pass 0):

● Read(input/sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2016.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Good, I have the first part. Now let me read the full paper without limit
  to get all content:

● Read(input/sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2016.md)
  ⎿  Read 253 lines

● Excellent! I now have the complete paper. Let me update the
  extraction.json with Pass 0 metadata and then proceed with the full
  extraction. I'll now execute the complete 8-pass extraction workflow
  autonomously.

● Read(outputs/variability-test/sobotkova-et-al-2016/run-04/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 63 lines

● Now I'll execute the full extraction workflow. Let me complete Pass 0

  continuously through all passes.
