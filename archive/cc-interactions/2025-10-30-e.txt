● Extraction Complete: Penske et al. 2023

  The 7-pass autonomous extraction workflow has been successfully completed for the Penske et al. 2023 archaeogenetics
  paper.

  Final Statistics

  Total Items Extracted: 248
  - Evidence: 85
  - Claims: 84
  - Implicit Arguments: 17
  - Research Designs: 7
  - Methods: 20
  - Protocols: 35

  Workflow Summary

  1. Pass 1 (Liberal Extraction): 205 items across 9 sections
  2. Pass 2 (Rationalization): 186 items (9.3% reduction)
  3. Pass 3 (RDMAP Extraction): 239 items - extracted from all 9 sections following your correction
  4. Pass 4 (Implicit RDMAP): 253 items (20.9% implicit, target met)
  5. Pass 5 (RDMAP Rationalization): 248 items (7.5% reduction)
  6. Pass 6 (Validation): PASS status achieved with 9 cross-reference repairs
  7. Summary Generation: Comprehensive summary.md created with quality metrics

  Key Outcomes

  - 100% Sourcing Compliance: All items properly sourced with verbatim_quote or trigger_text
  - Cross-Reference Integrity: All 248 items have valid bidirectional references
  - Conservative Consolidation: Lower reduction percentages (9.3%, 7.5%) justified by genuinely distinct technical
  content
  - RDMAP Extraction Correction Applied: Following your critical feedback, RDMAP extracted from all sections with special
   attention to Introduction/Discussion for research designs

  Deliverables

  All outputs saved to /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/penske-et-al-2023/:
  - extraction.json (validated)
  - summary.md (comprehensive overview)
  - Execution scripts for all passes
  - queue.yaml updated to completed status

  The extraction is ready for assessment, comparison analysis, and reproducibility evaluation.
