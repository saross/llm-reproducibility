● Now I'll proceed with Pass 2: Rationalise claims & evidence. For an
  interpretive philology paper, I should target:
  - 15-20% claims reduction (37 → ~30-32)
  - 0-5% evidence reduction (21 → ~20-21)

  Let me analyse for consolidation opportunities:

  Claims consolidation candidates:
  1. C009 supports C006 and both relate to Karians/barbarophonos - can merge
  2. C010 supports C005 and C012 supports C005 - supporting claims, keep
  separate
  3. C014 supports C013 - can merge as C014 is purely textual support
  4. C022 and C023 both support C021 - keep as distinct supporting evidence
  5. C036 and C037 are theoretical claims about oral tradition - can merge
  6. C019 is largely restating C018 - can merge

  Evidence consolidation:
  - E019 and E020 both about singular terminology for Akhaians - can merge
