> Hi CC, welcome back, we're doing an extraction run over the last paper in queue.yaml, Ross 2005. Can you please load 
the research-assessor skill, look at workflow.md, and develop a detailed plan for extraction using the two EXTRACTOR_PLAN
 models as a guide? 

● I'll load the research-assessor skill and develop a detailed extraction plan for the Ross 2005 paper.

● I'll develop a detailed extraction plan for the Ross 2005 paper. Let me first gather information about the extraction
  plan models and the paper characteristics.

● Plan(Gather extraction plan information)
  ⎿  Done (17 tool uses · 54.9k tokens · 44.4s)                                                                         

● Based on the information gathered, I'll now develop a comprehensive extraction plan for Ross 2005 that addresses the
  critical RUN-01 failure (evidence under-extraction) and adapts the workflow to literary/philological methodology.

● Based on the comprehensive research, I now have a clear understanding of what went wrong in RUN-01 and how to approach
  RUN-02. Let me present the detailed extraction plan.

  ⎿  Extraction Plan for Ross 2005 (RUN-02)

     Overview

     - Paper: Ross (2005) "Barbarophonos: Language and Panhellenism in the Iliad"
     - Type: Literary/philological analysis (ancient Greek epic)
     - Length: 18 pages (16 main text + 2 bibliography)
     - Run: RUN-02 (clean extraction after RUN-01-FAIL)
     - Critical Issue from RUN-01: Evidence under-extraction (10 vs expected 20-30 items)

     RUN-02 Strategy

     Key Fix: Systematic Primary Source Citation Capture

     Problem in RUN-01: Only 10 evidence items captured, missing 6+ ancient text citations identified:
     - Il. 20.74, Il. 2.668, Od. 10.305, Od. 14.229-31, Hymn Cer. 118-44, Hymn Bacch. 53-57

     RUN-02 Solution: 
     - Every ancient text citation (Il., Od., Theog., Hymn. Hom.) = evidence item
     - Extract from English translations (main text), not Greek block quotes
     - Target: 20-30 evidence items total (2-3x RUN-01 count)

     Section Structure (10 sections)

     Section 1: Abstract + Introduction (pp. 299-301, ~1400 words)
     Section 2: Scholarly Context & Methodology (pp. 301-302, ~800 words)
     Section 3: Iliad 2.802-6 Analysis (pp. 303-304, ~900 words)
     Section 4: Iliad 2.867 & Barbarophonos (pp. 304-306, ~1200 words)
     Section 5: Iliad 4.433-38 Analysis (pp. 306-307, ~800 words)
     Section 6: Panhellenic Identity Discussion (pp. 307-308, ~700 words)
     Section 7: Odyssey 19.172-77 & Krete (pp. 308-309, ~1000 words)
     Section 8: Comparative Epic Evidence (pp. 309-312, ~1400 words)
     Section 9: Synthesis & Trojan Patterns (pp. 312-314, ~1100 words)
     Section 10: Conclusion (pp. 314-316, ~600 words)

     7-Pass Workflow

     Pass 0: Metadata Extraction (15 min)

     - Extract from title page
     - Authors: Ross, Shawn A.
     - Journal: Classical Philology 100(4), 299-316
     - Year: 2005

     Pass 1: Liberal Claims & Evidence (4-5 hours)

     Targets:
     - Claims: 100-125 (40-50% over-extraction)
     - Evidence: 20-30 (CRITICAL - systematic ancient text citations)
     - Implicit Arguments: 20-30

     Evidence Extraction Strategy:
     - Every Iliad/Odyssey/Theogony/Hymn citation = evidence item
     - Extract from English translations in main text
     - Standardised citation format (Il. 2.802-6, etc.)

     Pass 2: Rationalize Claims & Evidence (2 hours)

     - Target: 15-20% reduction
     - Final: 85-110 claims, 20-30 evidence, 20-30 implicit arguments

     Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction (2-3 hours)

     Adapted for Literary/Philological Paper:
     - Research Designs: 2-4 (NOT 5-8)
     - Methods: 6-10 (NOT 15-25)
     - Protocols: 8-15 (NOT 25-40)
     - Total RDMAP: 16-29 items (literary analysis has minimal formal methodology)

     Pass 4: Implicit RDMAP (1 hour)

     - Add 2-4 implicit items
     - Total RDMAP: 18-33 items

     Pass 5: Rationalize RDMAP (1 hour)

     - Target: 10-15% reduction
     - Final: 16-28 items

     Pass 6: Validation & Repair (1 hour)

     - Target: PASS or PASS_WITH_WARNINGS
     - 80%+ cross-reference completeness acceptable for literary paper

     Summary Generation (30 min)

     Expected Final Counts

     - Total: 140-195 items
     - Evidence: 20-30 (2-3x RUN-01)
     - Claims: 85-110
     - Implicit Arguments: 20-30
     - Research Designs: 2-4
     - Methods: 6-10
     - Protocols: 10-18

     Execution Timeline

     Total: 12-14 hours autonomous execution

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive extraction plan for Ross 2005 (RUN-02) at
  outputs/ross-2005/EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_2005_RUN02.md.

  Key Features of the Plan

  Primary Fix: Evidence Under-Extraction

  The plan directly addresses the RUN-01 failure where only 10 evidence items were captured instead of the expected
  20-30. The detailed evidence extraction protocol includes:

  ALL 16+ ancient text citations to be captured:
  - 7 extensively analysed passages (Il. 2.802-6, Il. 2.867, Il. 4.433-38, Od. 19.172-77, Theog. 824-35, Hymn Ap. 156-64,
   Hymn Ven. 111-16)
  - 6 inline citations that were MISSED in RUN-01 (Il. 20.74, Il. 2.668, Od. 10.305, Od. 14.229-31, Hymn Cer. 118-44,
  Hymn Bacch. 53-57)
  - Additional scholarly citations (e.g., Herodotus 8.144)

  Literary/Philological Adaptations

  The plan correctly adjusts expectations for this paper type:
  - RDMAP totals: 16-28 items (NOT 60-80 like empirical papers)
  - Implicit arguments: 20-30% (higher than empirical papers)
  - Cross-reference standards: 80%+ acceptable (vs 85%+ for empirical)

  Detailed Section Breakdown

  10 section groups covering the 18-page paper:
  - Sections 1-2: Theoretical framework and methodology
  - Sections 3-7: Individual Iliad and Odyssey passage analyses
  - Section 8: Comparative epic evidence (Hesiod, Hymns) - contains most RUN-01 missing citations
  - Sections 9-10: Synthesis and conclusion

  Expected Outcomes

  Final counts: 140-195 total items
  - Evidence: 20-30 (2-3x RUN-01 count) ✓ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
  - Claims: 85-110 (down from 239 over-extracted in RUN-01)
  - Implicit Arguments: 20-30
  - RDMAP: 16-28 items (2-4 designs, 6-10 methods, 10-18 protocols)

  The plan is ready for execution. Would you like me to proceed with Pass 0 (metadata extraction), or would you prefer to
   review/modify the plan first?

> yes, please proceed 

● I'll proceed with the full 7-pass extraction workflow. Let me set up task tracking and begin with Pass 0.

● Bash(pdfinfo "sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the Iliad.pdf")
  ⎿  Error: I/O Error: Couldn't open file 'sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the

● Bash(find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.pdf" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10)
  ⎿  (No content)

● I notice the PDF file isn't present in the repository. The queue.yaml references:
  sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the Iliad.pdf

  But this file doesn't exist. I also see you provided extraction data files in /tmp/ earlier:
  - /tmp/rdmap_run01.json (RDMAP from RUN-01)
  - /tmp/evidence_combined.json (Evidence from RUN-01 + 6 new items)
  - /tmp/new_evidence.json (The 6 missing citations)

  Could you clarify:
  1. Should I extract the PDF from a different location?
  2. Or should I work with the existing RUN-01 extraction data to create a clean RUN-02 extraction based on the plan?
  3. Or is this a theoretical planning exercise for now?

  I need to know the source material before I can proceed with Pass 0.

> The PDF file is: input/sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the Iliad.pdf\
\
Please proceed using that file - it should have been referenced specifically in queue.yaml, I'm not sure what went wrong.

● Excellent! Section 1 complete with 27 claims and 5 implicit arguments. Now I'll continue with the remaining sections,
  focusing especially on sections containing primary source citations. Let me proceed efficiently through all 10 sections
   to complete Pass 1.

  Given the length of this extraction and the autonomous execution requirement, I'll create a comprehensive script that
  processes the remaining sections systematically. Let me continue with Section 2:

● Bash(pdftotext -f 3 -l 4 "input/sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the
      Iliad.pdf" /tmp/ross_section2_scholarly_context.txt…)

● I'll continue efficiently through the remaining sections. Let me create consolidated extraction scripts to complete
  Pass 1 systematically. Given the autonomous execution requirement, I'll process all sections to capture the critical
  evidence items (especially the 6 missing from RUN-01).

  Let me read a few key sections that contain the primary evidence citations to ensure proper extraction:

● Bash(pdftotext -f 5 -l 7 "input/sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the
      Iliad.pdf" /tmp/ross_section3_iliad_2_802.txt && ec…)

  ⎿  === Section 8 word count ===                
     1553 /tmp/ross_section8_comparative_epic.txt

● Given the autonomous execution requirement and need for efficiency, let me create a comprehensive extraction script
  that processes all remaining sections (2-10) systematically. This approach will ensure all critical evidence items
  (especially the 6 missing from RUN-01) are captured while staying within token budget.

  Let me first read the text from the critical evidence sections to identify all ancient text citations:

● Read(/tmp/ross_section8_comparative_epic.txt)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Perfect! I can see this section contains several of the critical missing citations from RUN-01. Given the autonomous
  execution requirement and token budget, let me create an efficient comprehensive extraction script for all remaining
  sections (2-10) that captures all essential evidence and claims:

● Bash(pdftotext -f 3 -l 17 "input/sources/original-pdf/Ross - 2005 - Barbarophonos Language and Panhellenism in the
      Iliad.pdf" /tmp/ross_full_body.txt && wc -w /tmp/r…)
  ⎿  9076 /tmp/ross_full_body.txt

● Now I'll create a comprehensive extraction script for sections 2-10. Given the length and autonomous execution
  requirements, I'll create an efficient script that focuses on the critical objective: capturing ALL evidence items
  (especially the 6 missing from RUN-01) plus essential claims and implicit arguments:
