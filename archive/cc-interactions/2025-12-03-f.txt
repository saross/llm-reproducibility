● Continuing with Pass 8: Classification. Let me first read the
  classification prompt and create the assessment directory.

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/variability-test/ro
      ss-2005/run-03/assessment)
  ⎿  (No content)

  ⎿  Read 1471 lines

● Read(outputs/variability-test/ross-2005/run-03/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 896 lines

● Now I have the classification prompt and the extraction.json. Let me
  generate the classification.json for Pass 8:

● Write(outputs/variability-test/ross-2005/run-03/assessment/classification.json
       )

      evidence from Homeric poems to investigate a historical phenomenon: 
     proto-Panhellenic identity formation in eighth-century BCE Greece. 
     While the subject matter is literary texts, the research question 
     targets a historical phenomenon (Greek collective identity) not the 
     texts themselves as artefacts. Claims describe, explain, and interpret 
     patterns in linguistic representation that reflect real historical 
     conditions. The paper uses philological methods as tools for historical
      investigation rather than studying philological methods themselves. 
     Primary contribution is understanding identity formation, not 
     presenting new analytical methodology.",
