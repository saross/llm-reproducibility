> > /compact   Session Context: Research Extraction Workflow v2.6 Ready for Testing

  Project Overview

  LLM-based research extraction system for analyzing methodology, claims, and evidence from academic papers. Currently
  transitioning from chatbot-based extraction (v2.5) to automated Claude Code workflow (v2.6).

  What We Accomplished This Session

  1. Installed research-assessor skill v2.6 to .claude/skills/
    - Skill auto-invokes when user requests research extraction
    - 5-pass workflow: Claims/Evidence Pass 1-2, RDMAP Pass 1-2, Validation Pass 3
  2. Created automated workflow infrastructure
    - input/queue.yaml: Processing queue (1 paper ready: Sobotkova et al. 2023)
    - input/WORKFLOW.md: Complete workflow documentation
    - input/, outputs/: Folder structure for batch processing
    - Key decision: Using PDFs directly (not markdown) - fits in 200K context window
  3. Archived v2.5 development artifacts
    - Moved planning/to-do/, test reports, deployment guide to archive/extraction-development/v2.5/
    - Kept only current reference materials active
    - Committed and pushed (commit 320d7d1)
  4. Repository cleanup
    - Organized for sharing and FAIR4RS compliance
    - Clear separation: active vs. archived materials

  Current State - Ready for First Test Run

  Workflow structure:
  Input: PDF → output/{paper-slug}/extraction.json, validation-pass3.md, summary.md
  Prompts: extraction-system/prompts/{claims-evidence,rdmap}_pass{1,2}_prompt.md
  Schema: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json

  Test paper queued:
  - Path: sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2023 - Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from historical
   maps using novice volunteers.pdf
  - Slug: sobotkova-et-al-2023
  - Status: pending

  Token budget: ~70-85K per paper (well within 200K limit)

  IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Test the Workflow

  User wants to run the first automated extraction test.

  Invocation: "Process the next paper in the queue using the research-assessor workflow."

  Expected workflow:
  1. Read PDF from queue
  2. Load blank schema from extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json
  3. Run 5 passes (claims/evidence 1-2, RDMAP 1-2, validation)
  4. Write outputs to outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/
  5. Update queue status to completed

  Notes:
  - Skill will need restart to auto-invoke (or manually follow prompts)
  - Each pass appends to JSON (persistent state)
  - Pass 3 produces MD report only (no schema changes)
  - Final step: generate human-readable summary

  Key Files

  - Workflow doc: input/WORKFLOW.md
  - Queue: input/queue.yaml
  - Prompts: extraction-system/prompts/
  - Schema: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json

  Ready to begin first v2.6 automated extraction test.

● I understand the context. Let me confirm my understanding of the workflow before we begin:

  Workflow Understanding

  5-Pass Extraction Process:
  1. Claims-Evidence Pass 1: Initial extraction of claims/evidence → update extraction.json
  2. Claims-Evidence Pass 2: Refinement/completion → update extraction.json
  3. RDMAP Pass 1: Research Design/Methods/Analysis extraction → update extraction.json
  4. RDMAP Pass 2: Refinement/completion → update extraction.json
  5. Validation Pass 3: Quality check → generate validation-pass3.md report only

  File Flow:
  - Input: sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2023 - Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from 
  historical maps using novice volunteers.pdf
  - Schema Template: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json (blank template to start)
  - Prompts: extraction-system/prompts/{claims-evidence,rdmap}_pass{1,2}_prompt.md
  - Outputs: outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/
    - extraction.json (cumulative, updated after each pass 1-4)
    - validation-pass3.md (pass 5 report)
    - summary.md (human-readable final output)

  Processing:
  - Read queue.yaml, identify next pending paper
  - Process using research-assessor skill (or follow prompts manually)
  - Each pass loads current extraction.json, makes updates, writes back
  - Update queue status to "completed" when done

  Key Constraints:
  - Direct PDF processing (no markdown conversion)
  - Token budget: ~70-85K per paper (well within 200K limit)
  - Persistent state: JSON accumulates across passes 1-4

  Ready to Proceed?

  Should I begin by:
  1. Reading the queue to confirm the paper details
  2. Loading the PDF and blank schema
  3. Executing Pass 1 (Claims-Evidence initial extraction)

  Or would you like me to clarify anything first?

> I am ready for you to proceed with one clarification: to remove all ambiguity, I have now prepended the prompt 
filenames with '01-', '02-', '03-', '04-', and '05-' indicating the order you should run them in. With that 
understanding, please proceed. 

● Understood! The numbered prefixes (01- through 05-) make the execution order crystal clear. Let me begin the extraction
   workflow.

● Read(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 312 lines

● I'm ready to begin Pass 1 extraction. Let me update my progress and start working through the paper systematically.

● Now I'll begin Pass 1 extraction. This is a substantial task, so I'll work through the paper systematically,
  identifying core claims first, then extracting evidence and supporting claims section by section.

  Initial scan complete. This is a methodological paper about crowdsourced digitization of burial mounds from historical
  maps. The core argument is about the efficiency and viability of their mobile-based crowdsourcing approach compared to
  alternatives (desktop GIS by experts, desktop GIS by volunteers, and machine learning).

  I'll now proceed with detailed extraction. Given the substantial length of this paper (13 pages with dense
  methodological and empirical content), I'll work through it systematically and produce a comprehensive extraction
  document.

  Starting extraction now...

  This will take some time to complete properly with full sourcing. Let me begin creating the structured extraction
  output following schema v2.5 requirements.

● Write(extraction.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 37 lines to extraction.json

● Now I'll begin the detailed extraction process. Due to the length and density of this paper, I'll need to work through
  it carefully to capture all evidence, claims, and relationships. Let me start building the extraction with core claims
  and evidence.

  Given the substantial scope of this extraction task and the need for precision in sourcing every item, I should note
  that this will require significant work. Let me proceed with creating a comprehensive extraction document by working
  through the paper systematically.

  Beginning full extraction now - this will take time to complete properly with all required verbatim quotes and 
  sourcing...

  Due to the length of this task, would you like me to:

  1. Complete the full extraction in this session (which will produce a very large output with 50-100+ evidence items,
  claims, and their relationships)
  2. Demonstrate the extraction approach with a representative sample showing proper technique, then complete the full
  extraction
  3. Work section-by-section with you confirming approach before proceeding

  Which would you prefer? The paper is dense with empirical data, methodological claims, and comparative arguments - a
  thorough Pass 1 extraction following all the sourcing requirements will be substantial.

> Ah, I am very happy you stopped me! I forgot a key instruction. Please work through each extraction prompt 
SECTION-BY-SECTION - i.e., focus on 'Abstract + Section 1 (Introduction)' using prompt 01, then focus on 'Section 2 
(Approach) usiing prompt 01, then Section 3, then Section 4 (Discussion) + Section 5 (conclusion) together (the 
conclusion is short). As you focus on each section, update the output schema. I would then recommend /compacting and 
continuing with prompt 02 in the same manner, section by section. Can you help me update workflow.md to capture this 
section-by-section approach? We've tested it both ways (whole paper and section-by-section) in the chatbot and section by
 section is much more effective. 

● Excellent clarification! Yes, section-by-section is much more manageable and thorough. Let me update the WORKFLOW.md
  first, then proceed with just Abstract + Section 1 (Introduction) for Pass 1.

● Read(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/input/WORKFLOW.md)

       27 +  ## Extraction Methodology: Section-by-Section Approach
       28 +  
       29 +  **IMPORTANT**: Each pass should be executed **section-by-section**, not on the entire paper at once. This
          +  approach has been tested and found significantly more effective for:
       30 +  - Maintaining focus and thoroughness
       31 +  - Ensuring proper sourcing and verbatim quotes
       32 +  - Managing cognitive load
       33 +  - Producing higher-quality extractions
       34 +  
       35 +  ### Recommended Section Division
       36 +  
       37 +  For each pass, work through the paper in these chunks:
       38 +  
       39 +  1. **Abstract + Introduction** (Section 1)
       40 +  2. **Methods/Approach** (Section 2)
       41 +  3. **Results** (Section 3)
       42 +  4. **Discussion + Conclusion** (Sections 4-5 together, if conclusion is short)
       43 +  
       44 +  After completing all sections for one pass, update the extraction.json file, then proceed to the next 
          + pass.
       45 +  
       46 +  ### Example Workflow for One Pass
       47 +  
       48 +  ```
       49 +  Pass 1 execution:
       50 +  1. Read prompt: 01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md
       51 +  2. Extract from: Abstract + Section 1 → update extraction.json
       52 +  3. Extract from: Section 2 → update extraction.json
       53 +  4. Extract from: Section 3 → update extraction.json
       54 +  5. Extract from: Sections 4-5 → update extraction.json
       55 +  6. Mark Pass 1 complete
       56 +  
       57 +  Then proceed to Pass 2 with same section-by-section approach.
       58 +  ```
       59 +

       101 +  - **Note**: Pass 5 is the only pass that reviews the entire paper at once
       102    
       103    ### Post-Processing
       104    1. **Generate summary**: Create `summary.md` with key entities and metadata from final JSON

● Perfect! Now let me update my todo list to reflect the section-by-section approach and then begin with Abstract +
  Section 1 (Introduction) only.

● Excellent! Now I'll proceed with Pass 1, Abstract + Introduction only. Let me extract claims and evidence from just
  these sections with proper sourcing.

● Read(extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 37 lines

● Now I'll work through Abstract + Introduction systematically, extracting evidence and claims with proper verbatim
  quotes. This is a comprehensive extraction focusing only on these sections.

  Given the length of this extraction (Abstract + Intro have substantial content), I'll work carefully to build a
  properly sourced extraction. Let me begin:

         "publication_year": 2023,
     … +465 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! I've completed Pass 1 extraction for Abstract + Introduction.

  What I extracted:

  Evidence: 11 items (E001-E011)
  - Quantitative outcomes (10,827 features, 241 hours, <6% error)
  - Resource descriptions (volunteers, software, equipment)
  - Process observations (training needs, system characteristics)

  Claims: 15 items (C001-C015)
  - Core claims (6): Main thesis about crowdsourcing efficiency, scalability, ML complementarity, system adaptability
  - Supporting/Intermediate (9): Data quality, efficiency thresholds, resource usage, comparison points

  Key relationships mapped:
  - Evidence supports multiple claims (proper cross-referencing)
  - Claims support higher-level claims (hierarchical structure)
  - All items have verbatim quotes and precise locations

  Next Steps:

  Would you like me to:

  1. Continue to Section 2 (Approach) - proceed with next section extraction
  2. Review this extraction first - check quality/completeness before continuing
  3. Update main extraction.json - merge this into the primary file and proceed

  The section-by-section approach is working well - this focused extraction captured all key evidence and claims from
  Abstract + Intro with proper sourcing. Ready to proceed when you are!

> Continue to Section 2. Also, for workflow.md, as a general rule, the Abstract can be done with the first section of the
 paper, and the Conclusion can be done with whatever section immediately proceeds it. 

● Perfect! Let me update the workflow.md with that guideline, then proceed to Section 2 (Approach).

● Update(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/input/WORKFLOW.md)
  ⎿  Updated ../../input/WORKFLOW.md with 10 additions and 3 removals                                              
       36    
       37    For each pass, work through the paper in these chunks:
       38    
       39 -  1. **Abstract + Introduction** (Section 1)
       39 +  **General rule:**
       40 +  - Abstract is typically processed with the first section of the paper
       41 +  - Conclusion is typically processed with the section that immediately precedes it
       42 +  
       43 +  **Typical division for most papers:**
       44 +  1. **Abstract + Introduction** (Abstract + Section 1)
       45    2. **Methods/Approach** (Section 2)
       46    3. **Results** (Section 3)
       47 -  4. **Discussion + Conclusion** (Sections 4-5 together, if conclusion is short)
       47 +  4. **Discussion + Conclusion** (Sections 4-5 together)
       48    
       49 -  After completing all sections for one pass, update the extraction.json file, then proceed to the next 
          - pass.
       49 +  Adjust based on paper structure - the key is manageable section sizes that maintain focus and 
          + thoroughness.
       50    
       51 +  After completing all sections for one pass, proceed to the next pass with the same section-by-section 
          + approach.

● Excellent! Section 2 (Approach) extraction complete.

  What I extracted from Section 2:

  New Evidence: 29 items (E012-E040)
  - Map/feature characteristics (density, coverage, symbol properties)
  - Participant characteristics (novice volunteers, equipment availability)
  - Failed 2010 approach details (volunteer attrition, support demands)
  - Design constraints and goals (short season, minimal training time)
  - System capabilities (offline operation, automation, validation)
  - Workflow specifications and evaluation methods

  New Claims: 15 items (C016-C030)
  - Feature characteristics and task simplicity (C016-C017)
  - Volunteer characteristics and prior failures (C018-C020)
  - Design philosophy and implementation (C021-C023)
  - Platform selection rationale (C024-C027)
  - Workflow design and automation benefits (C028-C030)

  All items properly sourced with verbatim quotes and cross-referenced to supporting evidence and higher-level claims.

  Summary of Progress:

  - ✅ Abstract + Intro: 11 evidence, 15 claims
