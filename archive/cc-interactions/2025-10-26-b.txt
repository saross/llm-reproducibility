● Validation successful - no data loss! Updated totals: 46 evidence items, 49 claims.

  Completed comprehensive liberal extraction through Methods sections 2.1-2.5, adding 24 new evidence items and 22 new
  claims from sections covering:
  - 2.3: Using a mobile application for map digitisation (decision factors for choosing FAIMS Mobile)
  - 2.4: Design and implementation of the recording system (7-stage workflow, automation features, streamlined interface)
  - 2.5: Evaluating the digitisation approach (inputs vs outputs tracking methodology)

  Continuing with Results section 3.1-3.5 (pages 6-9)...
