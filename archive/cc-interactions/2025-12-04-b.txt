● Pass 0 complete. Now proceeding with Pass 1 (Liberal Claims & Evidence
  Extraction). The paper has the following structure:

  - Abstract (quoted epigraph)
  - Introduction
  - The FAIMS Project
  - The FAIMS Mobile Platform
  - Customising and Deploying the FAIMS Mobile Platform
  - Between Off-the-Shelf and Bespoke Software
  - The Nature of Co-Development
  - Three Case Studies and Three Themes of Observation
    - Theme 1: Upfront Costs, Backend Payouts
    - Theme 2: Trade-Offs and Shared Lessons
    - Theme 3: Digital Recording and Archaeological Interpretation
  - Conclusions
  - Acknowledgments
  - References

  I'll extract liberally from each section group, targeting 40-50%
  over-extraction:

● Now I'll perform Pass 1 and Pass 2 (liberal extraction then
  rationalization) for claims and evidence. Given the methodological nature
  of this paper (focused on software co-development experiences), I expect
  more claims about process, benefits, and trade-offs than quantitative
  evidence.
