> Can you give me an update on the improvements that are complete, and those that still need to be done, especially 
around ensuring comprehensive extraction? 

‚óè Based on the handover documents, here's the status of extraction improvements:

  ‚úÖ Complete: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Implicit RDMAP)

  Phase 1: Split Architecture (Previous Session)

  - RDMAP extraction split from 1 pass into 3 dedicated passes:
    - Pass 3: RDMAP Explicit (documented methodology) - 368 lines
    - Pass 4: RDMAP Implicit (undocumented items) - 337 lines
    - Pass 5: RDMAP Rationalisation (consolidation)
  - All skill component files updated to reflect 6-pass structure (31 changes across 6 files)
  - Result: Cognitive model separation for higher reliability

  Phase 2: Implicit RDMAP Strengthening (Just Completed)

  Three targeted improvements to Prompt 04:

  1. Fix 4 - Priority Reframing (lines 35-49, +14 lines):
    - Changed from "assessment-critical" to "PRIMARY CONTENT with equal priority"
    - Added explicit: "Do not skip implicit scanning because Methods section exists"
    - Clarified implicit items found OUTSIDE Methods sections
  2. Fix 6 - Embedded Recognition Patterns (lines 142-171, +28 lines):
    - Self-contained 4-pattern quick reference
    - Each pattern: Question + Look for + Example + Basis
    - Reduces file-switching cognitive load
  3. Fix 3 - Quality Gates (lines 226-236, consolidated -8 lines):
    - Changed from field-population checks to process-verification
    - Requires scan methodology documentation in extraction_notes
    - Requires explanation if zero implicit items found

  Final Prompt 04: 337 lines (was 304, +33 net, under 350 budget)

  ---
  ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps (Not Yet Done)

  CRITICAL: Test Phase 2 improvements
  1. Commit Phase 2 changes (files ready but not committed)
  2. Re-extract Sobotkova et al. 2023 RDMAP using Prompts 03‚Üí04
  3. Validate: implicit items > 0, ratio 20-40%, scan methodology documented

  ---
  üìã Future: Comprehensive Extraction Reliability

  From planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md:

  High Priority (30 min each)

  1. Mandatory fundamentals reading (Prompts 01, 03):
    - Force reading of extraction-fundamentals.md before extraction
    - Establishes sourcing discipline early
    - Impact: Prevents 40-50% of sourcing failures
  2. Liberal extraction mental model (Prompts 01, 03):
    - Explicit "CAPTURE vs CONSOLIDATE" framing
    - Active rules: "When uncertain: EXTRACT IT"
    - Impact: Reduces over-consolidation, missed items

  Medium Priority (30-45 min each)

  3. Relationship mapping during extraction (Prompts 01, 03):
    - Map evidence‚Üíclaims, protocols‚Üímethods during extraction
    - Don't defer to consolidation pass
    - Impact: Improves coverage, notices gaps
  4. Verbatim quote quality standards (Prompt 01):
    - Self-check before writing to JSON
    - "Can I find this EXACT text with simple search?"
    - Impact: Reduces validation failures

  Low Priority (30 min, may not be needed)

  5. Scope management guidance (Prompts 01, 03):
    - Extract THIS paper's work only, not literature review
    - Impact: Prevents over-extraction of background
  6. Fix 7 - Mid-section checkpoints (1-2 hours):
    - Process monitoring with ratio checks
    - Note: May not be needed with split architecture

  ---
  Summary Priorities

  Right now:
  - ‚òê Commit Phase 2 changes
  - ‚òê Test on Sobotkova paper
  - ‚òê Validate implicit extraction works (expected 10-20 items vs 0 previously)

  After successful testing (~2-3 hours):
  - ‚òê Mandatory fundamentals reading (HIGH - biggest impact)
  - ‚òê Liberal extraction mental model (HIGH)
  - ‚òê Relationship mapping discipline (MEDIUM)
  - ‚òê Verbatim quote standards (MEDIUM)

  Total future work: ~2-3 hours for comprehensive extraction improvements across Prompts 01 and 03.

  Would you like me to commit the Phase 2 changes and proceed with testing, or focus on implementing the high-priority
  comprehensive extraction improvements first?

> can you please commit and push? Then, before we test, we'll implement some of the other improvements - they are 
different problems and shouldn't impinge on one another, we can test them both at once 

‚óè I'll commit and push the Phase 2 changes now.

‚óè Perfect! Phase 2 committed and pushed. Now I'll implement the high-priority comprehensive extraction improvements to
  Prompts 01 and 03. These focus on:
  1. Mandatory fundamentals reading (prevents 40-50% of sourcing failures)
  2. Liberal extraction mental model (reduces over-consolidation)

  Let me start with Prompt 01 (Claims/Evidence):

‚óè Read(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims_evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Error reading file

‚óè Search(pattern: "extraction-system/prompts/01*.md")
  ‚éø ¬†Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Read(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 338 lines

‚óè Now I'll add the two high-priority improvements to Prompt 01:

  Improvement 1: Add mandatory fundamentals reading (STEP 0)

‚óè Update(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md with 17 additions           
       191    
       192    ## Extraction Workflow
       193    
       194 +  ### STEP 0: MANDATORY Pre-Extraction (DO THIS FIRST)
       195 +  
       196 +  Before extraction begins, you MUST:
       197 +  
       198 +  1. **Read extraction fundamentals:**
       199 +     - File: `references/extraction-fundamentals.md`
       200 +     - Focus: Internalise the sourcing test: "Can I point to exact text?"
       201 +  
       202 +  2. **Acknowledge understanding:**
       203 +     - State: "I have read extraction fundamentals and understand the sourcing discipline"
       204 +  
       205 +  3. **Only then proceed to extraction**
       206 +  
       207 +  **WITHOUT completing Step 0, extraction will fail sourcing requirements.**
       208 +  
       209 +  ---
       210 +  
       211    ### STEP 1: Initial Scan
       212    - Read abstract and conclusion
       213    - Identify 5-10 CORE claims (main thesis)

‚óè Improvement 2: Add liberal extraction mental model to reinforce the philosophy

‚óè Update(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md with 19 additions
        83    
        84    **When uncertain whether something qualifies as evidence/claim: INCLUDE IT.**
        85    
        86 +  ### Liberal Extraction Mental Model
        87 +  
        88 +  **Pass 1 job:** CAPTURE (comprehensively)
        89 +  **Pass 2 job:** CONSOLIDATE (rationally)
        90 +  
        91 +  **Active rules during Pass 1:**
        92 +  - ‚úì When uncertain: EXTRACT IT
        93 +  - ‚úì When granular: KEEP IT SEPARATE
        94 +  - ‚úì When related items: DON'T CONSOLIDATE YET
        95 +  
        96 +  **Never think during Pass 1:**
        97 +  - ‚úó "This seems too detailed for final output"
        98 +  - ‚úó "These should probably merge"
        99 +  - ‚úó "I'm over-extracting"
       100 +  
       101 +  **Remember:** Pass 2 can merge. Pass 1 cannot recover missed items.
       102 +  
       103 +  ### Application
       104 +  
       105    - Better to over-extract and consolidate later than miss important content
       106    - Preserve granularity - we will consolidate in Pass 2 rationalization
       107    - Accept some over-extraction as expected and manageable

‚óè Perfect! Prompt 01 enhanced. Now I'll apply the same improvements to Prompt 03 (RDMAP Explicit):

‚óè Read(extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Read 369 lines

‚óè Now I'll add the same improvements to Prompt 03. First, add mandatory fundamentals reading as STEP 0:

‚óè Update(extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md with 20 additions and 1 removal

       149    ---
       150    
       151 -  ## Step 0: Pre-Scan for Research Designs
       151 +  ## Extraction Workflow
       152    
       153 +  ### STEP 0: MANDATORY Pre-Extraction (DO THIS FIRST)
       154 +  
       155 +  Before extraction begins, you MUST:
       156 +  
       157 +  1. **Read extraction fundamentals:**
       158 +     - File: `references/extraction-fundamentals.md`
       159 +     - Focus: Internalise the sourcing test: "Can I point to exact text?"
       160 +  
       161 +  2. **Acknowledge understanding:**
       162 +     - State: "I have read extraction fundamentals and understand the sourcing discipline"
       163 +  
       164 +  3. **Only then proceed to extraction**
       165 +  
       166 +  **WITHOUT completing Step 0, extraction will fail sourcing requirements.**
       167 +  
       168 +  ---
       169 +  
       170 +  ## STEP 1: Pre-Scan for Research Designs
       171 +  
       172    Before extracting RDMAP, quickly scan Abstract, Introduction, Background, and Methods/Approach sections 
             for design elements:
       173    - Mark decision language ("chose," "selected," "because")
       174    - Mark frameworks ("guided by," "framework," "informed by")

‚óè Now update the subsequent step numbers:

       222    
       223    **Scan Methods/Approach section for documented tactical approaches:**

       245    
       246    **Scan Methods/Approach section for documented operational procedures:**
       247    

‚óè Now enhance the Liberal Extraction Philosophy section with the explicit mental model:

  ‚éø ¬†Updated extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md with 19 additions                 
       131    
       132    This is Pass 1: **LIBERAL EXTRACTION**
       133    
       134 +  ### Liberal Extraction Mental Model
       135 +  
       136 +  **Pass 1 job:** CAPTURE (comprehensively)
       137 +  **Pass 2 job:** CONSOLIDATE (rationally)
       138 +  
       139 +  **Active rules during Pass 1:**
       140 +  - ‚úì When uncertain: EXTRACT IT
       141 +  - ‚úì When granular: KEEP IT SEPARATE
       142 +  - ‚úì When related items: DON'T CONSOLIDATE YET
       143 +  
       144 +  **Never think during Pass 1:**
       145 +  - ‚úó "This seems too detailed for final output"
       146 +  - ‚úó "These should probably merge"
       147 +  - ‚úó "I'm over-extracting"
       148 +  
       149 +  **Remember:** Pass 2 can merge. Pass 1 cannot recover missed items.
       150 +  
       151 +  ### Application to RDMAP
       152 +  
       153    **When uncertain:**
       154    - About tier (design vs method vs protocol): **INCLUDE IT** (Pass 2 will rationalise)
       155    - About boundaries (one item or two): **EXTRACT BOTH** (Pass 2 will consolidate)

‚óè Perfect! Both prompts enhanced with comprehensive extraction improvements. Let me commit and push:

‚óè Excellent! All improvements committed and pushed. Here's what's been completed:

  ‚úÖ Phase 2: Implicit RDMAP Improvements (Prompt 04)

  Commit: a3c5664

  Three targeted fixes to strengthen implicit extraction:
  - Fix 4: Reframed as "PRIMARY CONTENT" (+14 lines)
  - Fix 6: Embedded 4-pattern recognition guide (+28 lines)
  - Fix 3: Process verification quality gates (-9 lines)
  - Final length: 337 lines (under 350 budget)

  ‚úÖ Comprehensive Extraction Improvements (Prompts 01, 03)

  Commit: de2592f

  Two high-priority improvements to both prompts:

  Improvement 1: Mandatory Fundamentals Reading

  - Added STEP 0 before all extraction steps
  - Forces reading of extraction-fundamentals.md
  - Requires acknowledgement: "I understand the sourcing discipline"
  - Impact: Prevents 40-50% of sourcing failures

  Improvement 2: Liberal Extraction Mental Model

  - Explicit CAPTURE vs CONSOLIDATE framing
  - Active rules: "When uncertain: EXTRACT IT"
  - Anti-patterns: "Never think 'I'm over-extracting'"
  - Clear reminder: "Pass 1 cannot recover missed items"
  - Impact: Reduces over-consolidation and missed items

  Structural changes:
  - Prompt 01: Enhanced "Extraction Philosophy" section
  - Prompt 03: Renumbered steps (0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4), enhanced "Liberal Extraction Philosophy"

  ---
  Ready for Testing

  All improvements address different problems and can be tested together:
  - Phase 2 targets: Implicit RDMAP extraction (0 items ‚Üí expected 10-20)
  - Comprehensive targets: Sourcing quality + Liberal extraction consistency

  Next: Test on Sobotkova et al. 2023 paper with complete extraction workflow (Passes 1-6)

  Would you like me to proceed with testing now, or would you prefer to review the changes first?

> what do you think of the value versus risk of:\
\
  Medium Priority (30-45 min each)

  3. Relationship mapping during extraction (Prompts 01, 03):
    - Map evidence‚Üíclaims, protocols‚Üímethods during extraction
    - Don't defer to consolidation pass
    - Impact: Improves coverage, notices gaps
  4. Verbatim quote quality standards (Prompt 01):
    - Self-check before writing to JSON
    - "Can I find this EXACT text with simple search?"
    - Impact: Reduces validation failures\
\
Should we implement these improvements now, or should I test first? 

‚óè I recommend TEST FIRST for these reasons:

  Value vs Risk Assessment

  Relationship Mapping (Medium value, Low risk)

  Value:
  - Could improve coverage by forcing explicit thinking about connections
  - May catch gaps during extraction rather than later

  Risk:
  - Minimal - this is already in both prompts (Prompt 01:257-260, Prompt 03:255-277)
  - Would be enhancement of existing guidance, not new requirement

  Reality check:
  - Prompt 01 already has "Map Relationships" as explicit step
  - Prompt 03 has detailed relationship mapping section
  - This would be making existing guidance more prominent/prescriptive

  Verbatim Quote Quality (Medium value, Very low risk)

  Value:
  - Could reduce validation failures
  - Self-check procedure catches errors before commit

  Risk:
  - Very low - this is reinforcement of existing requirements
  - Lines 32-50 of Prompt 01 already emphasize verbatim quote discipline heavily

  Reality check:
  - Verbatim quote requirements already prominently featured
  - Multiple warnings already in place
  - This would add structured self-check procedure

  Why Test First

  1. Scientific method:
  - We've modified 3 prompts with substantial changes
  - Need baseline to measure incremental improvements
  - If problems occur, easier to diagnose with fewer variables

  2. Diminishing returns:
  - High-priority improvements address KNOWN failure modes (40-50% sourcing failures, zero implicit items)
  - Medium-priority are enhancements, not critical fixes
  - Already have strong verbatim quote emphasis

  3. Implementation reality:
  - Relationship mapping already in workflows
  - Verbatim quotes already heavily emphasized
  - These would be "making louder" not "adding new"

  4. Efficiency:
  - Test takes ~1-2 hours (one paper, full extraction)
  - If current improvements work well, may not need medium-priority ones
  - If current improvements reveal issues, informs what medium-priority improvements are actually needed

  5. Risk of over-engineering:
  - Prompts are already detailed (Prompt 01: 356 lines, Prompt 03: 387 lines)
  - Adding more guidance might create cognitive overload
  - Test will show if current level is sufficient

  Recommendation

  Test now with current improvements:
  - Phase 2 implicit RDMAP (Prompt 04)
  - Mandatory fundamentals (Prompts 01, 03)
  - Liberal extraction mental model (Prompts 01, 03)

  Then decide on medium-priority based on results:
  - If sourcing failures persist ‚Üí Add verbatim quote self-check
  - If relationship gaps appear ‚Üí Enhance relationship mapping guidance
  - If both work well ‚Üí May not need additional changes

  The improvements we've made target the high-impact problems. Testing now validates whether they work and informs
  whether medium-priority improvements are needed.

  Your call: Test first, or implement the medium-priority improvements too?

> ok, great, I'll clear context before we run the extraction, but let's do some cleanup first. Can you look at reports 
and planning and see if anything has been superceded or is otherwise no longer needed? If you find anything, please move 
it to the appropriate place in archive/ . Feel free to consolidate remaining to-dos from different planning documents if 
that helps clean up the folder. Please also move the last run (entire folder) from output/ to archive/output/cc-sonnet45 
and append '-RUN-07' as per the existing pattern in the target folder. Reset input/queue.yaml to prepare for a new run on
 the same paper. 

‚óè I'll help clean up and prepare for the test run. Let me start by exploring what needs to be reviewed:

‚óè Perfect! Cleanup complete. Here's what was done:

  ‚úÖ Cleanup Complete

  1. Planning Directory Streamlined (31 ‚Üí 13 files)

  Archived 17 completed documents to archive/planning/completed-analyses-2025-10/:

  Implicit RDMAP fixes (7 docs):
  - implicit-rdmap-extraction-fixes-implementation.md (superseded by remaining-tasks-summary.md)
  - implicit-extraction-comparison-analysis.md (diagnostic complete)
  - implicit-extraction-architecture-comparison.md (split decision made)
  - implicit-arguments-gap-diagnosis.md
  - implicit-arguments-rdmap-regression-investigation.md
  - prompt-architecture-assessment.md
  - liberal-extraction-execution-guide.md (extracted into remaining-tasks-summary.md)

  Verification docs (4 docs):
  - skill-component-files-verification-complete.md
  - split-architecture-skill-verification.md
  - skill-improvement-implementation-plan.md
  - skill-improvement-risk-assessment.md

  Analysis & comparison (6 docs):
  - research-design-extraction-gap-analysis.md
  - transparency-metric-documentation-gap.md
  - chatbot-extraction-02-vs-current-comparison.md
  - RUN-01-vs-current-comparison.md
  - workflow-improvements-from-comparison.md
  - extraction-challenges-monitoring.md

  Remaining 13 active files:
  - remaining-tasks-summary.md (current roadmap)
  - Future work plans (cwts, schema, future-workflow)
  - Reference guides (prompt-to-skill optimization, prompt-vs-skill division)
  - Skill assessments (reference material)
  - README.md

  2. Last Run Archived

  Moved: outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/ ‚Üí archive/output/cc-sonnet45/sobotkova-et-al-2023-RUN-07/

  Archive now contains: RUN-00-fail through RUN-07 (8 historical runs)

  3. Queue Reset for Testing

  queue.yaml updated:
  - Status: completed ‚Üí pending
  - Notes: Ready for RUN-08 test with Phase 2 + comprehensive improvements
  - References: Previous run location documented

  4. Documentation Created

  archive/planning/completed-analyses-2025-10/README.md:
  - Explains what was archived and why
  - Documents Phase 1-2 completion status
  - Links to active planning document
  - References implementation commits

  ---
  Ready for Testing

  System state:
  - ‚úÖ All improvements committed and pushed
  - ‚úÖ Planning folder cleaned (31 ‚Üí 13 files)
  - ‚úÖ Last run archived (RUN-07)
  - ‚úÖ Queue reset for new run
  - ‚úÖ Outputs directory empty

  Next: Run full 6-pass extraction on Sobotkova et al. 2023 to validate:
  1. Phase 2 implicit RDMAP improvements (expect 10-20 implicit items vs 0 previously)
  2. Comprehensive extraction improvements (mandatory fundamentals + liberal mental model)

  Ready when you are!
