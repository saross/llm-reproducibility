       245 +  **Total mappings verified:** 89
       246    
       247 -  **Mapping Quality Issues Identified:**
       247 +  **Mapping Quality Results:**
       248    
       249 -  1. **C044 → E041**: WEAK - "Low attrition" indicates satisfaction, but doesn't directly 
           - demonstrate "high digitisation rate"
       249 +  **Strong mappings:** 88
       250 +  - All major claims appropriately supported by direct measurements, observations, or calculations
       251 +  - Evidence clearly demonstrates or directly measures the claimed phenomena
       252 +  - Verbatim quotes or quantitative data align with claim assertions
       253    
       254 -  All other claim→evidence mappings verified as appropriate.
       254 +  **Weak mappings:** 1
       255 +  - **C044 → E041**: "Low attrition indicated satisfaction" supports volunteer satisfaction, but 
           + only indirectly supports claim that "volunteers could attain and maintain high digitisation rate"
       256 +    - E055 provides strong support for C044, making this weak link non-critical
       257 +    - Attrition relates to satisfaction/retention, not directly to digitisation velocity
       258    
       259 +  **Incorrect mappings:** 0
       260 +  
       261 +  **Claim→Evidence Mapping Score: 98.9%** (88 strong / 89 total)
       262 +  
       263 +  **Assessment:** Claim-evidence mapping is excellent. Only 1 weak link identified, and that claim 
           + (C044) has alternative strong evidence support (E055). No incorrect mappings found.

       387 +  
       388 +  ### Mapping Issues Identified
       389 +  
       390 +  **Only 1 weak mapping found:**
       391 +  
       392 +  1. **C044 → E041** (Claim→Evidence):
       393 +     - **Issue:** "Low volunteer attrition" (E041) supports satisfaction but only indirectly 
           + supports "high digitisation rate" claim
       394 +     - **Severity:** Low - C044 has strong alternative support from E055 (fastest digitisers data)
       395 +     - **Impact:** Non-critical - claim remains well-supported
       396 +  
       397 +  **No incorrect mappings found.**
       398 +  
       399 +  ### Key Findings
       400 +  
       401 +  1. **Excellent mapping quality (99.1%)** - 109/110 mappings are strong and appropriate
       402 +  2. **No structural mapping errors** - All relationship types correctly aligned
       403 +  3. **RDMAP hierarchy well-maintained** - Methods implement designs, protocols implement methods
       404 +  4. **Evidence strongly supports claims** - 88/89 claim→evidence links are direct and strong
       405 +  5. **Only 1 trivial issue** - Single weak link (C044→E041) is non-critical due to alternative 
           + evidence
       406 +  
       407 +  ### Mapping Strengths
       408 +  
       409 +  **Claim→Evidence (98.9%):**

     ## Sobotkova et al. (2023) Extraction Quality Evaluation
     **Paper:** Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from historical maps using novice volunteers
     **Assessment Date:** 2025-11-02

● Excellent! Let me update the todo list and provide a summary:

● Perfect! The full, long assessment of the Sobotkova et al. (2023) extraction is complete. Here's the summary:

  Assessment Complete ✅

  Overall Results: Grade A (Excellent) - 97.5%

  Items assessed: 153 (73 claims, 58 evidence, 7 methods, 10 protocols, 5 designs)
  Mappings assessed: 110 (89 claim→evidence, 9 method→design, 12 protocol→method)

  | Pass                | Score | Grade | Key Finding                         |
  |---------------------|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|
  | Pass A: Accuracy    | 94.1% | A-    | 6 errors in 5 items (all in claims) |
  | Pass B: Granularity | 99.3% | A     | Only 1 under-split (C004)           |
  | Pass C: Mapping     | 99.1% | A     | Only 1 weak link (C044→E041)        |

  Key Findings

  ✅ Strengths:
  - Perfect RDMAP extraction: 100% accuracy, 100% granularity (methods, protocols, designs)
  - Perfect evidence extraction: 100% accuracy, 100% granularity (58/58 items)
  - No hallucinations or confabulations - all errors are categorisation/context issues
  - Excellent consolidation judgment - appropriate balance of atomic principle vs functional usefulness

  ⚠️ Issues Identified (5 items, 8 total issues):
  1. C018 - Misattribution (literature claim categorised as empirical) - HIGH PRIORITY
  2. C004 - Context error + under-split (flagged in Pass A + B) - HIGH PRIORITY
  3. C032 - Context verification needed - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  4. C028 - Miscategorisation + page error - LOW PRIORITY
  5. RD-IMP-001 - Duplicate trigger_locations - LOW PRIORITY

  Output Files Created

  All files in /tmp/assessment-long/:

  1. ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md - Comprehensive narrative report (production-ready summary)
  2. final-assessment.json - Structured assessment data (machine-readable)
  3. pass-a-accuracy-working.md - Detailed Pass A findings
  4. pass-b-granularity-working.md - Detailed Pass B findings
  5. pass-c-mapping-working.md - Detailed Pass C findings

  Fitness for Use

  Production-ready with minor corrections. RDMAP and evidence components are excellent. Claims require 5 targeted
  corrections (2 high priority, 1 medium, 2 low) but overall quality supports research transparency and
  replicability assessment.

  The assessment confirms the extraction system is performing at a high level with isolated, addressable issues
  concentrated in claims categorisation and context handling.

> I'd like to discuss these results with you, but we are almost out of context. Can you compose a /compact message 
taht will allow us to smoothly continue this work?

● Compact Summary: Full Long Assessment of Sobotkova et al. 2023 Complete

  Task Completed

  Successfully completed full/long assessment of sobotkova-et-al-2023 extraction (153 items + 110 mappings) across
  three dimensions:

  - Pass C (Mapping): 99.1% - 1 weak link
  - Overall Grade: A (97.5%)

  Key Findings

  ✅ Perfect: RDMAP (100%) and Evidence (100%) extraction
  ⚠️ Issues: 5 claims need corrections (C004, C018, C028, C032 + RD-IMP-001)

  Output Files (in /tmp/assessment-long/)

  1. ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md - Comprehensive narrative (has MD linting warnings to fix)
  2. final-assessment.json - Structured data
  3. pass-a-accuracy-working.md - Detailed Pass A
  4. pass-b-granularity-working.md - Detailed Pass B
  5. pass-c-mapping-working.md - Detailed Pass C

  Current Issue

  ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md has 48 markdown linting warnings (MD022 blank lines around headings, MD032 blank lines
  around lists, MD036 emphasis as heading, MD024 duplicate headings, MD031 fenced code blocks).

  Next Steps

  1. Fix markdown linting issues in ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md
  2. Optional: Move files to permanent location (currently in /tmp/)
  3. Discussion of results/findings if needed

  Assessment Quality: Production-ready with minor corrections needed. RDMAP/Evidence perfect; Claims need 5
  targeted fixes (2 high priority, 1 medium, 2 low).
