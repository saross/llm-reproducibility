● I'll continue with Pass 3-5: RDMAP extraction. Let me first read the
  current extraction.json and the source paper to extract research designs,
  methods, and protocols.

● Read(outputs/variability-test/sobotkova-et-al-2016/run-05/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 1208 lines

● Read(input/sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2016.md)
  ⎿  Read 253 lines

● Now I'll extract the RDMAP (Research Designs, Methods, Protocols) from
  this methodological paper. This paper is about software co-development
  rather than primary archaeological fieldwork, so the research design is
  reflective/evaluative case study rather than experimental or
  observational.
