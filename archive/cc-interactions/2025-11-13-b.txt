> Hi CC, you were working on phase 3 of \
\
  Documentation Update v2.6 - Session Summary

  Completed: Phase 1 - Critical Fixes ✅

  All 4 tasks complete:
  1. ✅ Updated main README.md - v2.6, 7-pass workflow, fixed all archived skill-documentation/ references → docs/research-assessor-guide/
  2. ✅ Created extraction-system/README.md - comprehensive overview of extraction toolkit
  3. ✅ Created outputs/README.md - complete guide to extraction outputs and usage
  4. ✅ Renamed ARCHIVE_INDEX.md → archive-index.md (lowercase-with-hyphens convention)

  Next: Phase 2 - User Guide Updates (13 remaining tasks)

  Immediate priorities:
  - Update docs/user-guide/extraction-workflow.md (5-pass → 7-pass, add Pass 0 and Pass 6)
  - Update docs/user-guide/getting-started.md (fix archived refs, 7-pass workflow)
  - Update docs/user-guide/schema-reference.md (v2.4 → v2.6)
  - Update docs/README.md (fix refs, update to 7-pass)

  Then: Phase 3 (Skill docs), Phase 4 (FAIR4RS), Phase 5 (examples/), Phase 6 (additional READMEs), Phase 7 (global cleanup)

  Key Decisions Made

  User preferences confirmed:
  - Skill documentation location: docs/research-assessor-guide/ (NOT in .claude/skills/)
  - Create examples/ directory with sample extractions
  - Version: v2.6 (incremental from v2.5)
  - Primary audience: Researchers using the tool

  Current workflow: 7 passes (0-6) + validation (Pass 7):
  - Pass 0: Metadata
  - Pass 1-2: Claims/Evidence
  - Pass 3-5: RDMAP (explicit, implicit, rationalization)
  - Pass 6: Infrastructure (PIDs, FAIR, funding, permits)
  - Pass 7: Validation

  Todo List Status

  17 tasks total: 4 complete, 13 pending

  Next task queued: Update docs/user-guide/extraction-workflow.md (estimated 2 hours - substantial rewrite for 7-pass workflow)\
\
when VS code crashed, can you please resume where you left off? 

● I'll resume Phase 3 work. Let me first check the current todo list state and identify where we left off.

● Read(planning/active-todo-list.md)
  ⎿  Read 712 lines

● Bash(git status --short)
  ⎿   M .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/fair-principles-guide.md
      M .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/pid-systems-guide.md
      M README.md
     … +40 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see from git status that Phase 1 is complete (README.md, extraction-system/README.md, outputs/README.md all modified, archive files renamed/moved). Let me
  check what session notes or documentation exists about Phase 3 work to understand exactly where we left off.

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-13-a.txt)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Search(pattern: "docs/research-assessor-guide/**/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● I can see Phase 3 hasn't been started yet - there are no files in docs/research-assessor-guide/. Let me check what Phase 3 tasks were planned and create the todo
  list to resume.

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-12-a.txt)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines

● Let me check the earlier part of the 2025-11-12 interaction to see what documentation update plan was discussed:

● Bash(grep -n "Phase 3" /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-12-a.txt | head -20)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me search for the broader documentation update plan in your session summary:

● Bash(grep -A 50 "Documentation Update v2.6" /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-12-a.txt | head -80)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me check what docs exist in the skill folder to understand the current state:

● Bash(ls -la /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/.claude/skills/research-assessor/ | head -20)
  ⎿  total 24

     /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/docs/background-research/replicats-report.md
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Based on your summary and the git status, I can see that Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) is complete. You mentioned Phase 3 was for "Skill docs". Let me reconstruct what
  Phase 3 work needs to be done by checking which skill documentation was archived and needs to be recreated in the proper location:

● Bash(ls -la /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/documentation-archive/skill-documentation/)
  ⎿  total 176                                     
     drwxrwxr-x 2 shawn shawn  4096 Nov 11 15:37 .
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn  4096 Nov 13 13:44 ..
     … +10 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I understand. Phase 3 is to recreate the skill documentation in docs/research-assessor-guide/ based on the archived files. Let me create a todo list and
   start the work:

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/docs/research-assessor-guide)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Now let me read the archived README to understand the structure and update it for the new location and v2.6:

● Read(archive/documentation-archive/skill-documentation/README.md)
  ⎿  Read 397 lines

● Now I'll create the updated README.md for v2.6 with the 7-pass workflow and correct references:

● Write(docs/research-assessor-guide/README.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 486 lines to docs/research-assessor-guide/README.md
