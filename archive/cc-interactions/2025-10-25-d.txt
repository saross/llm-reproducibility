> /compact   Session Summary: Fix Implicit Arguments & Research Design Extraction Gaps (v2.6.1)

  What We Accomplished

  Successfully diagnosed and fixed two critical extraction gaps identified through chatbot vs CC
  comparison on Sobotkova et al. 2023 paper:

  Gap 1: Implicit Arguments (0 → 8-12 expected)
  - CC extracted 0, chatbot extracted 10
  - Root cause: Prompts had guidance but lacked systematic workflow emphasis
  - Fixed by adding required 4-type framework to Pass 1 & Pass 2 prompts
  - Now requires systematic search for EACH core claim with documentation if none found

  Gap 2: Research Designs (2 → 3-6 expected)
  - CC extracted 2 holistic frameworks, chatbot extracted 5 distinct strategic decisions
  - Root cause: No granularity guidance on when to split design elements
  - Fixed by adding granularity principle to skill references and prompts
  - Core rule: Each strategic decision requiring independent justification = separate RD

  Key Findings from Comparison

  Quantitative differences:
  - Total items: 85 (CC) vs 64 (chatbot) - CC more comprehensive
  - Evidence: 36 (CC) vs 13 (chatbot) - CC captured more granular measurements
  - Claims: 31 (CC) vs 16 (chatbot) - CC preserved inferential steps
  - Implicit arguments: 0 (CC) vs 10 (chatbot) - CRITICAL GAP now fixed
  - Research designs: 2 (CC) vs 5 (chatbot) - GRANULARITY GAP now fixed

  Quality assessment:
  - Both had 100% source verification
  - Different consolidation philosophies: CC conservative (3%), chatbot aggressive (69%)
  - CC's approach better for assessment (preserves assessability), now enhanced with implicit arguments

  Overall verdict: CC workflow is production-ready with v2.6.1 fixes

  Next Steps

  For user:
  1. Test v2.6.1 on new paper extraction
  2. Verify implicit arguments extracted (target: 8-12)
  3. Verify research designs granular (target: 3-6)
  4. Consider implementing deferred improvements incrementally (see future-workflow-improvements.md)

  What's ready:
  - ✅ Skill v2.6.1 active in .claude/skills/ (no restart needed)
  - ✅ All prompts updated in extraction-system/prompts/
  - ✅ WORKFLOW.md v2.6.1 with file management guidance
  - ✅ All changes committed and pushed to main
  - ✅ Documentation updated with schema sync protocol

  Repository State

  - Branch: main
  - Latest commit: d48336f "Fix implicit arguments and research design extraction gaps (v2.6.1)"

  - Status: All changes committed, pushed, clean working directory

  Context for Next Session

  Skill version: research-assessor v2.6.1
  - Implicit arguments: Systematic 4-type framework required for all core claims
  - Research designs: Each strategic decision = separate RD (design language keywords, conservative
  consolidation)
  - File management: Direct writes to extraction.json only (no intermediate files)

  Testing priority: Run full 5-pass extraction on new paper to validate both fixes work autonomously.

  Deferred improvements available in: planning/future-workflow-improvements.md
  - Fundamentals reading requirement (STEP 0)
  - Liberal extraction mental model strengthening
  - Relationship mapping emphasis
  - Verbatim quote quality standards
  - Scope management guidance

> Hi CC welcome back! In the last session you'll see that we made some improvements to the research 
assessment workflow. Can you please look at the recent planning documents and see if there are any other 
to-dos left before we do another test run? 

● I'll review the recent planning documents to identify any outstanding to-dos before the next test run.

● Search(pattern: "planning/*.md")

● Looking at the recent planning documents, here's the status of outstanding to-dos:

  Completed (v2.6.1)

  ✅ Implicit arguments fix - Added systematic 4-type framework to Pass 1 & Pass 2 prompts✅ Research 
  design granularity fix - Added granularity principle to skill references and prompts✅ All changes 
  committed and pushed

  Outstanding Before Test Run

  Based on the implementation plan in workflow-improvements-from-comparison.md, there are optional 
  validation tasks that could be done first:

  Phase 3: Manual Validation on Sobotkova (Optional)

  These tasks would validate the fixes before testing on new paper:

  1. Manual implicit argument extraction
    - Read Sobotkova paper with new guidance
    - Extract implicit arguments targeting ~10 items
    - Compare with chatbot's 10 to validate approach
  2. Review research designs
    - Evaluate if CC's 2 designs should have been 5 with new guidance
    - Map chatbot's 5 designs to paper sections
  3. Spot-check consolidations
    - Review E032-E036 (productivity calculations) - appropriate split?
    - Review C020-C022 (approach characteristics) - appropriate split?

  Phase 4: Test on New Paper (Next Step)

  This is likely what you mean by "another test run" - autonomous extraction with v2.6.1 to verify:
  - Implicit arguments: 8-12 extracted
  - Research designs: 3-6 with distinct rationales
  - Overall quality maintained

  Deferred Improvements

  The 5 improvements in future-workflow-improvements.md are explicitly deferred until after testing
  v2.6.1:
  - Fundamentals reading requirement (STEP 0)
  - Liberal extraction mental model strengthening
  - Relationship mapping emphasis
  - Verbatim quote quality standards
  - Scope management guidance

  ---
  My recommendation: We can proceed directly to Phase 4 (test on new paper) unless you want to do the
  Phase 3 manual validation first. The manual validation would give higher confidence but takes more time.
   What's your preference?

> Ok, I'd like to run the workflow against the same paper to see if we get improved results. Please do not
 consider the outcomes of the prior run when doing so - if you think that knowledge of the prior run will 
'contaminate' this run, let me know, and I'll clear context. Otherwise, please review input/WORKFLOWS.md 
and confirm you understand the process. Invoke the 'research-assessor' skill as needed. Let me know if you
 have any questions, otherwise you can begin. 

● I should address the contamination question before we begin.

  Contamination Assessment:

  There is a minor risk that knowledge of the prior extraction could influence this run:
  - I know the prior run extracted 0 implicit arguments (might cause overcompensation)
  - I know chatbot extracted 10 specific implicit arguments (might anchor on those)
  - I know the prior run had 2 RDs vs chatbot's 5 (might bias granularity decisions)

  However, the v2.6.1 improvements provide strong safeguards:
  - Systematic 4-type framework for implicit arguments (objective checklist)
  - Design language keywords for RD identification (concrete search criteria)
  - Section-by-section extraction from paper text (grounded in source)

  My recommendation: The contamination risk is low enough to proceed because the new frameworks are
  systematic and objective. The main "contamination" would be increased vigilance for implicit arguments
  and RD granularity, which is actually the intended effect of v2.6.1.

  However: If you want perfect independence for comparison purposes, clearing context would be safer.

  What's your preference? Should I:
  1. Proceed now (accept minor contamination risk, faster)
  2. Clear context first (perfect independence, you'd need to restart session)

  Let me know and I'll either review WORKFLOW.md and begin, or wait for you to clear context.

> I would like to make a 'clean' comparison, I'll save this conversation to the archive, then clear 
context. I'll be back momentarily. 

● Perfect, that's the right call for a clean comparison. I'll wait here while you:
  1. Save this conversation to archive
  2. Clear context
  3. Return to start the v2.6.1 test run fresh

  See you shortly!
