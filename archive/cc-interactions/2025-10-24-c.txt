> Hi Claude, we're resuming work from archive/cc-interactions/2025-10-24-b.txt. First, can you confirm you have access to
 the 'research-assessor' skill? 

● I can see that my <available_skills> section is currently empty, which means I don't have access to the
  'research-assessor' skill at the moment.

  However, I can see from the recent git commit that you installed research-assessor v2.6 to .claude/skills/. Let me
  check if the skill files are present in the repository:

● Bash(ls -la .claude/skills/)
  ⎿  total 24                                      
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 24 18:26 .
     drwx------ 3 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 24 18:44 ..
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The skill files are present in .claude/skills/SKILL.md. It looks like the skill might be installed but not loaded in my
   current session. Skills typically need to be activated or may load automatically depending on the configuration.

  Would you like me to try invoking the skill using the Skill tool to see if it becomes available?

> please try invoking the skill tool to see if it becomes available. 

● Let me first check the SKILL.md file to see what the skill is named:

● Read(SKILL.md)
  ⎿  Read 268 lines

● Now let me try to invoke the skill:
  ⎿  Error: Unknown skill: research-assessor

● Unfortunately, the skill is not loading. While the skill files are present at .claude/skills/SKILL.md (I can read the
  file content), the skill is not appearing in my <available_skills> list, so I cannot invoke it using the Skill tool.

  This might require:
  1. A restart of the Claude Code session to pick up the newly installed skill
  2. Some configuration change to enable the skill
  3. Or there might be an issue with how the skill is installed

  Since I can read the skill documentation and all the reference materials directly from .claude/skills/, I can still
  work with the research-assessor extraction workflow by:
  - Reading the extraction prompts you provide
  - Following the skill's decision frameworks and principles
  - Consulting the reference materials in .claude/skills/references/ as needed

  Would you like to proceed this way, or would you prefer to try restarting the Claude Code session to see if the skill
  loads properly?

> Ok, I just restarted Claude Code, so I need you to search the web and try to diagnose the problem.

● Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)
  ⎿  Received 1.8MB (200 OK)

● Found the issue! According to the official documentation:

  Skills must be in subdirectories, not directly in .claude/skills/

  The correct structure should be:
  .claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md

  But your current structure appears to be:
  .claude/skills/SKILL.md

  Let me verify the current structure:

● Bash(find .claude/skills -type f -name "*.md" | head -20)
  ⎿  .claude/skills/references/verification-procedures.md          
     .claude/skills/references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md
     .claude/skills/references/checklists/expected-information.md
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Diagnosis: Incorrect Directory Structure

  The skill isn't loading because SKILL.md is directly in .claude/skills/ but it needs to be in a subdirectory named
  after the skill.

  Current structure:
  .claude/skills/SKILL.md  ❌

  Required structure:
  .claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md  ✓

  Let me fix this:

● Bash(cd .claude/skills && mkdir -p research-assessor && mv SKILL.md research-assessor/ && mv references research-assessor/)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(tree .claude/skills -L 2)
  ⎿  Error: .claude/skills  [error opening dir]

     0 directories, 0 files

● Bash(ls -la .claude/skills/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: cannot access '.claude/skills/': No such file or directory

● Bash(ls -la .claude/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: cannot access '.claude/': No such file or directory

● Bash(ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ 2>&1 | head -20)
  ⎿  ls: cannot access '/home/shawn/.claude/skills/': No such file or directory

● Bash(find /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility -type d -name ".claude" 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/.claude

● Bash(pwd)
  ⎿  /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/.claude/skills

● Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 12                                                    
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn 4096 Oct 24 22:31 .
     drwx------ 3 shawn shawn 4096 Oct 24 22:31 ..
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn 4096 Oct 24 22:31 research-assessor

● Bash(ls -la research-assessor/)
  ⎿  total 24                                      
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 24 22:31 .
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 24 22:31 ..
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! The directory structure is now correct:

  .claude/skills/research-assessor/
  ├── SKILL.md
  └── references/

● Now let me try invoking the skill to see if it loads:
  ⎿  Error: Unknown skill: research-assessor

● The directory structure has been fixed, but Claude Code needs to be restarted for the skill to load.

  According to the documentation, skills are loaded at startup by pre-loading their name and description into the system
  prompt. Since we just restructured the directory while the session was running, the skill won't appear in my
  <available_skills> list until you restart Claude Code.

  Summary of fix:
  - Problem: SKILL.md was directly in .claude/skills/ instead of a subdirectory
  - Solution: Moved to .claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md with references
  - Next step: Restart Claude Code to load the skill

  Once you restart, I should be able to invoke the research-assessor skill using the Skill tool.
