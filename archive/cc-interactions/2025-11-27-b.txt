> Hi CC, welcome back, I've been away from this project for a week, can you 
review archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-17-d.txt and 2025-11-18-a.txt and 
help me recall where we left off, and what we need to do next? 

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-17-d.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1088 lines

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-18-a.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1203 lines

● Based on those session logs, here's where you left off:

  Summary of Last Sessions (Nov 17-18)

  Phase 7: Credibility Assessment System - Step 2 Complete

  You completed the Pass 8 classification prompt
  (assessment-system/prompts/classify-research-approach.md) with:
  - Two-stage classification (paper type → research approach)
  - Four paper types: empirical, methodological, theoretical, meta-research
  - HARKing detection, taxonomy feedback mechanism
  - 1,427 lines with 11-step workflow

  Documentation Updates Complete (Nov 18)

  Updated entire codebase from schema v2.5 → v2.6 and 7-pass → 8-pass
  workflow:
  - New Pass 6: Infrastructure Extraction (13 sections, FAIR scoring)
  - Old Pass 6 (Validation) renumbered to Pass 7
  - Commit 9538587

  Pre-commit Hook Created

  Enforces lowercase-with-hyphens filenames (you caught Claude slipping into
   ALL CAPS)

  ---
  What's Next

  Immediate blockers identified at session end:

  1. Create manifest file - version info currently only inline in READMEs
  2. Document extraction-launch.md - key workflow entry point but poorly
  documented

  Then continue to Step 3 (Classifier Testing):

  - Test classifier on 3 papers (3 runs each)
  - Blocker: ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 only has
  infrastructure-pass6-extraction.json - needs full extraction before
  classification testing
  - Other 2 papers ready: sobotkova-et-al-2024, penske-et-al-2023

  ---
  Would you like me to:
  1. Start with the manifest file and extraction-launch.md documentation?
  2. Jump straight to the ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 extraction?
  3. Check current queue.yaml status first?

> let's finish the documentation first, please create the manifest and 
extraction-launch.md. One question: what are your thoughts on stand-alone 
manifest files vs. incorporating them into all readmes where it makes sense 
to do so? 

● Good question - here are my thoughts:

  Standalone Manifest vs README-Integrated

  Standalone manifest file (e.g., manifest.yaml):

  | Pros                            | Cons                               |
  |---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | Single source of truth          | Another file to maintain           |
  | Machine-parseable (scripts, CI) | Can drift from documentation       |
  | Clear versioning for releases   | Less visible when browsing         |
  | Git tags can reference it       | Overkill for non-software projects |

  Integrated into READMEs:

  | Pros                               | Cons                             |
  |------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Visible where people actually look | Multiple places to update        |
  | Context-specific per component     | Risk of inconsistency            |
  | Human-friendly                     | Harder to parse programmatically |

  My Recommendation: Hybrid

  For this project specifically (research methodology, not software
  package), I'd suggest:

  1. Single manifest.yaml as source of truth - tracks schema version,
  workflow version, component versions, dates
  2. READMEs include version badges/headers that reference the manifest
  conceptually (human-readable summaries)
  3. CLAUDE.md references the manifest so I always know current versions

  This gives you:
  - One place to update versions (manifest)
  - Human context in READMEs where relevant
  - Machine-parseable if you ever want scripts to check versions
  - Clear audit trail

  The manifest doesn't need to be complex - just enough to track the key
  version numbers that currently live scattered across files.

  What's your preference? I can implement whichever approach suits your
  workflow best.

● Good news - I can see ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 is now marked as
  completed in queue.yaml! That means we can proceed to classifier testing
  after this documentation work.

  I also spotted several version inconsistencies to fix. Let me create the
  manifest and clean everything up.

  Results Summary

  | Field            | Value        |
  |------------------|--------------|
  | Paper Type       | Empirical    |
  | Primary Approach | Deductive    |
  | Confidence       | High         |
  | Taxonomy Fit     | Excellent    |
  | HARKing Flag     | No (matched) |
  | Transparency     | High         |

  Key Finding: Classification Differs from Expectation

  Expected: empirical/inductive
  Classified: empirical/deductive

  Rationale: This is a validation study testing ML predictions against field
   data:
  - ML model generates predictions (functioning as hypotheses)
  - Predictions tested against comprehensive ground truth
  - Results confirm/reject predictions (high error rates → rejection)
  - Design explicitly uses "validation" language (RD001, RD002)

  Mixed Methods Note: Paper has secondary inductive elements (failure mode
  analysis - "why did the model detect roads instead of mounds?") but
  primary structure is deductive validation.

  ---
  Framework Selected: deductive_emphasis
  - Primary signals: Validity, Robustness, Replicability
  - Secondary signals: Transparency, Comprehensibility, Plausibility

  ---
  Output: outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2024/assessment/classification.json

  This is good test data - the classifier may disagree with human
  expectations, which helps calibrate the taxonomy. Ready to check context
  before paper #2?

> That actually makes sense, and opens up particular lines of critique of 
the paper, in that I don't think we explicitly approached it as a deductive 
paper where the fieldwork tests RS outcomes as hypotheses, it makes me see 
the paper in a new light even though I'm a co-author... 

● That's a genuinely valuable outcome - and exactly what the classifier is
  designed to surface.

  The insight cuts both ways:

  For the paper's strengths:
  - The validation structure IS rigorous - you have comprehensive ground
  truth, you test predictions systematically, you report honest results
  - The "negative results" framing (RD003) is actually MORE credible in a
  deductive frame - you tested predictions and they failed

  For potential critique:
  - Were the ML predictions treated as formal hypotheses with a priori
  specification?
  - Was there explicit pre-registration of what would constitute
  success/failure thresholds?
  - The 60% probability threshold (M007) - was this set before or after
  seeing results?
  - RD002 (comparing curated vs uncurated training data) - was this planned
  from the start or emerged after first run failed?

  For credibility assessment:
  When we run Pass 9, the deductive framework will ask harder questions
  about:
  - Validity: Was the ground truth truly independent? (Yes - field survey
  predated ML work)
  - Robustness: Sensitivity to analytical choices? (Two runs helps, but
  threshold selection unclear)
  - Replicability: Code/data sharing? (Need to check infrastructure
  extraction)

  This kind of "seeing your own work differently" is precisely the value
  proposition - the structured extraction forces explicit framing that
  informal reading allows to remain implicit.

  Classification Matches Expectation ✓

  Expected: methodological/software_tool
  Classified: methodological/software_tool with inductive validation

  Key Evidence:
  - Claims are capability descriptions ("FAIMS includes features...",
  "designed for offline use...")
  - Case studies (from Sobotkova et al. 2016) are demonstrative, not primary
   contribution
  - No hypothesis-testing of software performance
  - No systematic benchmark comparison (ODK comparison is qualitative
  positioning)
  - Appropriate for SoftwareX journal format

  Framework Selected: methodological_paper
  - Primary signals: Transparency, Replicability, Comprehensibility
  - Secondary signals: Validity, Plausibility
  - Deemphasised: Generalisability, Robustness (of case studies)

  Classification Matches Expectation ✓

  Expected: empirical/deductive
  Classified: empirical/deductive

  Key Evidence for Deductive:
  - RD007: Explicit pathogen hypothesis testing → hypothesis REJECTED
  - Statistical hypothesis testing throughout (f4-statistics, qpAdm with
  p-values)
  - Claims report confirmatory/disconfirmatory outcomes ("earlier than
  anticipated", "no evidence for pathogens")
  - Methodological triangulation (RD006) for robust hypothesis confirmation

  2/3 matched expectations, 1/3 produced interesting divergence
  (sobotkova-et-al-2024 classified as deductive validation study rather than
   expected inductive, which you found insightful as a co-author).

  All three classifications have high confidence, excellent taxonomy fit,
  and no HARKing flags. The classifier appears to be functioning as
  designed.
