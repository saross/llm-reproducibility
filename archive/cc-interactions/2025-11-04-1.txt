● Pass 6 infrastructure extraction complete. Both remaining papers have been processed:

  connor-et-al-2013: 99 evidence, 76 claims, 22 methods, 13 infrastructure sections, FAIR 10/16 (62.5%, moderately FAIR),
   PID 1/6 (minimal connectivity)

  ross-et-al-2009: 112 evidence, 135 claims, 12 methods, 13 infrastructure sections, FAIR 8/16 (50.0%, moderately FAIR),
  PID 1/6 (minimal connectivity)

  Both papers represent methodologically rigorous archaeological research with detailed methods descriptions appropriate
  for their publication years (2013 and 2009 respectively), but lack modern open science infrastructure elements like
  author ORCIDs, dataset repositories, and code sharing.

> ok, can you give me a summary of what you've done since the last time we spoke, which was after you did an inital 
evaluation of a couple of papers but before you wrote the scripts, prompts, and schema updates. Did you create a detailed
 human-readable report on these to publications? If not, present me a little more detail here in chat first, and we'll 
decide what should go into the report. 

● Since we last spoke, I completed Pass 6 infrastructure extraction for the remaining papers in the batch. Here's what I
  did:

  Work Completed This Session

  1. Merged sobotkova-et-al-2016 infrastructure (created in previous session but not yet merged)
  2. Processed connor-et-al-2013 - read 53-page PDF, extracted infrastructure, merged
  3. Processed ross-et-al-2009 - read 15-page PDF, extracted infrastructure, merged

  I did NOT create detailed human-readable reports - just the infrastructure JSON extractions merged into each paper's
  extraction.json file.

  Key Findings Worth Highlighting

  Connor et al. 2013 (Quaternary Science Reviews)

  - Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using pollen, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility from Bulgarian Thracian Plain
  - 7 authors, including Ross & Sobotkova
  - 7 funding sources (ARC LP0989901 + 6 others)
  - 13 AMS radiocarbon dates covering ~37,500 cal BP to present
  - FAIR: 10/16 (62.5%) - Good methods, but no dataset DOI, no ORCIDs, subscription access
  - Key issue: Supplementary data mentioned extensively but no URL/DOI in draft version

  Ross et al. 2009 (Journal of Field Archaeology)

  - Remote sensing methodology paper - QuickBird satellite imagery + ground control vs traditional survey
  - 3 authors: Ross, Sobotkova, Burgers
  - Methodologically exceptional: Compared remote sensing (29 sites in 70 person-days) vs MTS survey (63 sites in 350
  person-days)
  - Key insight: Image features mostly reveal environmental conditions (water sources) amenable to settlement, not
  subsurface archaeology directly
  - FAIR: 8/16 (50.0%) - Excellent methods transparency, honest about failures (63% false positives), but proprietary
  imagery, no data sharing
  - No funding listed

  Should I Create Detailed Reports?

  I can create human-readable markdown reports covering:
  - Detailed FAIR assessment findings
  - Cross-paper patterns (e.g., TRAP project continuity, evolving practices 2009→2024)
  - Infrastructure strengths/weaknesses
  - Recommendations for improving reproducibility

  What would you like me to include?

> hmm...maybe the best thing to do now that we have the extracted information we need it to turn back to analysis; an 
actual analysis will be more useful than some sort of interim report. Can you look at the to-do list and other documents 
and remind me what the next analysis steps are?

  Next Analysis Step: Section 5, Phase 1 - Empirical Analysis

  Status: All 10 papers now have complete extractions (Pass 0-6) ✅Next Task: Systematic quality and metrics analysis

  Phase 1: Empirical Analysis (4-6 hours estimated)

  This involves analyzing the 10 completed extractions to answer key questions:

  1. Count Distributions
    - Extract item counts across all papers (evidence, claims, implicit arguments, designs, methods, protocols)
    - Look for patterns by paper type (empirical vs theoretical, short vs long, etc.)
  2. Quality Assessment Using Rubric
    - Apply planning/extraction-assessment-rubric-v1.md to identify:
        - Goldilocks papers (just right - balanced extraction)
      - Under-extracted papers (missing key information)
      - Over-extracted papers (excessive granularity, noise)
  3. Granularity Consistency Check
    - Are similar concepts split/merged consistently across papers?
    - Do papers show appropriate granularity for their discipline/methods?
  4. Target-Seeking Behaviour Detection
    - Do extractions stop prematurely when hitting numeric targets?
    - Are marginal items included to reach targets?
    - Does providing numeric guidance help or harm quality?
  5. Decision Point
    - Keep numeric ranges with better framing, OR
    - Remove numeric guidance entirely and rely on principles

  What This Enables

  This analysis will inform whether to:
  - Keep/modify metrics guidance in prompts
  - Proceed with multi-run variation study (Section 7)
  - Expand to new papers with confidence

  Context From Recent Work

  You've already completed Section 5a (cross-paper error analysis follow-up), which fixed systemic issues:
  - Bidirectional mapping inconsistencies
  - Verbatim quote fidelity
  - Schema field name standardization

  Now Phase 1 focuses on extraction quantity/granularity rather than technical errors.

  Would you like me to start Phase 1 empirical analysis now? I can extract metrics from all 10 papers and begin the
  quality assessment.

> ah, I see we're low on context; can you please compose a /compact message? 

● Summary for Continuation

  Just Completed (This Session)

  Pass 6 Infrastructure Extraction - Added reproducibility infrastructure metadata (13-section FAIR assessment) to final
  2 papers:
  - connor-et-al-2013: Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (7 authors, 7 funding sources, 13 radiocarbon dates, FAIR
  10/16, PID 1/6)
  - ross-et-al-2009: Remote sensing methodology (3 authors, QuickBird satellite imagery, methodologically excellent with
  honest failure reporting, FAIR 8/16, PID 1/6)

  Also merged sobotkova-et-al-2016 infrastructure from previous session.

  Project State

  ✅ All 10 papers now complete with Pass 0-6 extractions + infrastructure metadata:
  - ross-2005 (philology)
  - ross-et-al-2009 (remote sensing)
  - connor-et-al-2013 (palaeoecology)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2016 (FAIMS co-development)
  - eftimoski-et-al-2017 (landscape archaeology)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2021 (mobile GIS)
  - ross-ballsun-stanton-2022 (preregistration methodology)
  - penske-et-al-2023 (archaeogenetics)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2023 (crowdsourcing)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2024 (CNN validation)

  Each has: extraction.json (evidence, claims, implicit_arguments, research_designs, methods, protocols) +
  reproducibility_infrastructure (FAIR assessment, PIDs, funding, data/code availability)

  Next Task: Section 5 Phase 1 - Empirical Analysis

  From: planning/active-todo-list.md Section 5

  Goal: Analyze 10 completed extractions to assess quality, identify patterns, inform metrics guidance decisions

  Tasks (4-6 hours estimated):
  1. Extract count distributions across all papers
  2. Apply quality rubric to identify goldilocks/under-extracted/over-extracted papers
  3. Check granularity consistency
  4. Detect target-seeking behaviour (do numeric targets help or harm?)
  5. Decide: keep/modify/remove numeric guidance in prompts

  Deliverable: Empirical analysis report informing whether to proceed with multi-run variation study or expand to new
  papers

  User Request

  User asked what analysis steps come next after infrastructure extraction. I identified Phase 1 empirical analysis from
  active-todo-list.md. User then noted low context and requested this /compact message.

  We are in PLAN MODE - no execution yet, just planning next steps.
