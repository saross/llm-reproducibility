> Hi CC, VS code crashed. You'd just produced a first-class overview / discussion / initial ideas for actually 
*assessing* the CEM graphs - did you write that out anywhere, or has it been lost? 

● Let me check if I wrote that discussion anywhere before the crash:

● I'm afraid I can't find where that discussion was written. I've checked:

  - Recent markdown files in the project (nothing in last 3 hours)
  - The outputs/batch-analysis/ directory (only has structural assessment docs)
  - Planning and docs directories
  - Temp directories

  It looks like the discussion may have only been in the terminal output/conversation and wasn't written to a file before
   VS Code crashed.

  However, I'd be happy to recreate that discussion about assessing the CEM graphs. Could you give me a quick reminder of
   what we were focusing on? For example:

  - Assessing mapping quality (strong vs weak relationships)?
  - Evaluating graph completeness (are all claims connected to evidence)?
  - Analysing graph patterns (what do the relationship structures tell us)?
  - Designing an assessment rubric for the CEM graphs specifically?

  Let me know what aspect you'd like me to dive back into, and I can regenerate that first-class overview for you (and
  this time we'll save it somewhere!).

> Ok, let me see if I can recall my prompt. We are getting very good CEM graph results. I'd like you to review the 
documents in docs/background-research/ carefuly, especially the report 'repliCATS_Seven_Signals_HASS_Adaptation.md'. Then
 I'd like your help understanding where to go from here - I've spent so long on the details of extraction that I've lost 
sight of how we are going to approach analysis. our overall goal, as you may recall, is to assess - qualitatively and, 
perhps, quanitatively) the reliability or credibility of the papers we're examining ('reproducibility', which important, 
will only be possible - or appropriate - for a subset of papers in our long-tail domains, which have a lot of inductive 
and abductive research). I'd really appreciate from you some ideas to kick off a discussion between us about how to best 
approach the analysis of the papers we're analysing, somethign to guide us as we transition to that phase of work. Please
 be sure to write out your thoughts to a file as well as presenting them here, in case anything happens to the terminal. 

● I'll help you think through the transition from extraction to analysis. Let me first review the background research
  documents to ground my thinking in the repliCATS framework and your project goals.

● Perfect! I've written a comprehensive transition framework document to
  /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/planning/EXTRACTION_TO_ANALYSIS_TRANSITION.md. Let me give you the key takeaways
  here:

  The Core Insight

  You've built exactly what repliCATS assumed would be manual - the structured extraction of claims, evidence, and
  methods. The analysis phase isn't a new project; it's activating the second half of your system.

  Five Analysis Approaches I'm Proposing

  1. Signal-by-Signal Assessment (Systematic Rubrics)
  - Create detailed 0-100 scoring rubrics for each of the seven repliCATS signals
  - Apply systematically to generate credibility scorecards
  - Can be human or LLM-assisted
  - Best for: Comprehensive credibility profiles

  2. Pattern-Based Analysis (Cross-Paper Learning)
  - Mine recurrent patterns (like the "missing mappings" and "extreme C:E ratio" patterns you've already found)
  - Build credibility failure taxonomy
  - Best for: Understanding systematic issues across the field

  3. Graph-Based Metrics (Quantitative Structure)
  - Derive credibility indicators from CEM graph structure:
    - Evidential Support Density (mappings/claims)
    - Transparency Completeness Index (RDMAP integrity)
    - Scope Constraint Score (% claims with explicit bounds)
    - Robustness Triangulation Index (evidence diversity)
    - Replicability Infrastructure Score (repository links + verification)
  - Best for: Rapid quantitative baseline, automated triage

  4. LLM Multi-Agent Assessment (repliCATS IDEA Adaptation)
  - Deploy 3-5 independent LLM agents per paper
  - Each assesses signals with score ranges + justifications citing CEM graph IDs
  - Aggregate with uncertainty quantification
  - Validate against human expert panel
  - Best for: Scalable, auditable assessment

  5. Minimal Viable Indicators (Quick Triage)
  - 6 high-signal binary checks (has research design? C:E ratio acceptable? has repo links? etc.)
  - Traffic light scoring (red/yellow/green)
  - Best for: Rapid screening, prioritisation

  Recommended 12-Week Implementation

  Weeks 1-2: Foundation
  - Define detailed rubrics for seven signals
  - Build graph query toolkit (Python/jq scripts)
  - Pilot assess 2-3 papers manually

  Weeks 3-4: Quantitative Baseline
  - Implement graph metrics (ESD, TCI, SCS, RTI, RIS)
  - Generate quantitative profiles for all 10 papers
  - Identify patterns and outliers

  Weeks 5-6: Qualitative Deep Dive
  - Full rubric assessment on 3 diverse papers
  - Compare to quantitative metrics
  - Refine rubrics

  Weeks 7-9: LLM Automation
  - Build multi-agent assessment pipeline
  - Run on 5 papers, compare to human assessments
  - Calibrate and identify biases

  Weeks 10-12: Full Corpus
  - Deploy to all 10 papers
  - Cross-paper pattern analysis
  - Comprehensive reporting

  The Direct Mapping You Have

  Your CEM graphs already contain what you need for each signal:

  | Signal            | What Your Extraction Provides                                         |
  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Comprehensibility | Explicit/implicit claims, scope qualifiers, claim→evidence links      |
  | Transparency      | Research designs, RDMAP hierarchy, protocol specifications            |
  | Plausibility      | Domain context, comparanda citations, chronological references        |
  | Validity          | Evidence→claim mappings, C:E ratios, alternative interpretations      |
  | Robustness        | Evidence type diversity, triangulation patterns, sensitivity analyses |
  | Replicability     | Repository links, data/code availability, workflow documentation      |
  | Generalisability  | Claim scope declarations, limitation statements, bounds               |

  Immediate Week 1 Actions

  1. Define rubrics for all seven signals (8-12 hours) → planning/CREDIBILITY_ASSESSMENT_RUBRICS_V1.md
  2. Build graph query toolkit for metric extraction (6-10 hours) → assessment-system/analysis_toolkit.py
  3. Pilot manual assessment of 1-2 papers to test rubrics (4-6 hours per paper)

  Key Decisions Needed

  1. Descriptive vs normative? → Recommend hybrid (objective metrics + evaluated judgment)
  2. Domain-specific standards? → Same framework, differentiated baselines by research type
  3. Human validation level? → Moderate (expert panel assesses 20-30%, calibrate LLMs)
  4. Uncertainty representation? → Interval scores (lower/best/upper)
  5. Public reporting? → Constructive, anonymised aggregates; private individual scorecards

  The Bottom Line

  You're not lost - you're at a natural transition point. You've built the extraction infrastructure that makes
  credibility assessment possible. Now you're building the assessment layer that makes it actionable.

  The repliCATS framework gives you a proven roadmap. Your CEM graphs give you the data. The document I've just written
  gives you concrete approaches and a phased plan.

  What would be most helpful to discuss first? Rubric development? Graph metrics? LLM assessment architecture? Or would
  you like to start by manually assessing one paper together to see how it feels?

> ok, great, this is *really* helpful. Let me answer some of the decisions, then you can update. (1) I agree with the 
hybrid approach, especially early on while we are exploring what is possible. (2) For now, I'd like to continue focusing 
on 'long tail' domains, particularly fieldwork domains, because they are neglected and they share a number of 
characteristics (methods; abductive approach / serendipitous discovery). We're working in a challenging problem space, 
where different approaches (abductive, inductive, deductive) are all used, or mixed (appropriately or not!) - but this is
 my area of expertise and someplace where I think we can make a real contribution. I can see a time when we might have 
doucmentation in the research-assessor skill that provides domain-specific guidance... (3) Yes, we'll do some human 
calibration - I'd like to get the LLM framework set up as best as possible first, to ensure efficient and targetted 
validation / calibraton. (4) I definetly think we should avoid unwarranted precision and should focus on something lake 
interval scores or broad marks of some kind. (5) I'm a fan of open review, but I'm not sure it's appropraite here so 
let's defer this decision while we work on practical matters. \
\
I'm inclined to work on rubric development next, but I think I've noticed one other extraction matter reading your 
proposal - we've focused on intrincis paper elements (claims, evidence, methods, etc. - the hard part!) but I think we 
also need to look at some extrinsic or superficial features of the paper, like 'is there a link to a data repository?', 
'is there a link to executable software?', etc., so that we can start assessing the analytical / computational 
reprocucibility of the paper (I can foresee a time when we might work together on automating that reproduction if the 
necessary artefacts are available...). What do you think? Is this somethign we should explore first, perhaps working on 
another prompt for an additional pass that collections open science markers / links? 

● Excellent decisions - you've given clear direction on all key points. And you've spotted something really important
  that we need to address.

  The Missing Piece: Reproducibility Infrastructure

  You're absolutely right. We've done the hard work of extracting intrinsic argumentative structure (claims, evidence,
  methods), but we haven't systematically captured extrinsic reproducibility infrastructure:

  - Data repository links (Zenodo, OSF, figshare, Open Context, tDAR, institutional repos)
  - Code repository links (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
  - Dataset DOIs
  - Software DOIs
  - License declarations
  - Preregistration links
  - Data availability statements
  - Code availability statements
  - Supplementary materials
  - FAIR/CARE compliance indicators

  This is critical for the Replicability signal - you can't assess analytical reproducibility without knowing whether the
   analytical artefacts are actually available.

  Why This Should Come First

  Before rubric development, we need to know what data we'll have available. If the replicability rubric is going to
  score "data repository presence" and "link resolution", we need those systematically extracted.

  The good news: This is much easier than CEM/RDMAP extraction because these elements:
  - Appear in predictable locations ("Data Availability", "Code Availability", "Supplementary Information" sections)
  - Have recognisable patterns (URLs, DOIs)
  - Don't require deep semantic understanding
  - Are relatively sparse (present/absent, not complex relationships)

  Proposed Approach: Reproducibility Infrastructure Scan

  I recommend we create a lightweight, focused extraction pass (or post-processing scan) that captures:

  Core Elements to Extract

  reproducibility_infrastructure:
    data_availability:
      - statement_present: true/false
      - statement_text: "verbatim data availability statement"
      - repository_links:
          - url: "https://zenodo.org/record/..."
            repository_type: "Zenodo"
            link_resolves: true/false
            content_type: "dataset"
            doi: "10.5281/zenodo...."
      - restrictions:
          - type: "Indigenous data sovereignty"
            justification: "Data governed by community protocols"
            aligns_with_CARE: true

    code_availability:
      - statement_present: true/false
      - statement_text: "verbatim code availability statement"
      - repository_links:
          - url: "https://github.com/..."
            repository_type: "GitHub"
            link_resolves: true/false
            content_type: "analysis_code"
            license: "MIT"

    preregistration:
      - preregistered: true/false
      - preregistration_links:
          - url: "https://osf.io/..."
            platform: "OSF"
            registration_date: "2023-01-15"

    supplementary_materials:
      - present: true/false
      - types: ["tables", "figures", "datasets", "code", "protocols"]
      - location: "publisher website" / "repository" / "author website"
      - links: [...]

    open_science_badges:
      - badges: ["Open Data", "Open Materials", "Preregistered"]
      - source: "journal"

    fair_compliance:
      - findable: "assessment notes"
      - accessible: "assessment notes"
      - interoperable: "assessment notes"
      - reusable: "assessment notes"

    metadata_quality:
      - dataset_metadata_present: true/false
      - metadata_standard: "Dublin Core" / "DataCite" / etc.
      - readme_present: true/false

  Implementation Options

  Option A: New Extraction Pass (Pass 7)
  - Add to workflow after Pass 6
  - Systematic, integrated with existing extraction
  - Becomes part of canonical extraction output
  - Pros: Complete, integrated, version-controlled
  - Cons: Requires workflow modification, re-extraction of corpus

  Option B: Lightweight Supplementary Scan
  - Separate script that augments existing extractions
  - Scans paper text for specific sections/patterns
  - Outputs reproducibility_infrastructure.json alongside extraction.json
  - Pros: Can run on existing corpus immediately, non-invasive
  - Cons: Separate artefact, needs to be kept in sync

  Option C: Post-Processing Enhancement
  - Read existing extractions, add new fields
  - Combines text scanning with existing evidence/methods review
  - Updates extraction.json in place
  - Pros: Single output file, can leverage existing extractions
  - Cons: Modifies existing validated extractions

  My Recommendation: Option B initially, migrate to A if valuable

  Start with a lightweight supplementary scan that:
  1. Doesn't require re-running full extraction
  2. Can be tested and refined quickly
  3. Outputs clearly separated reproducibility_infrastructure.json
  4. If it proves valuable, integrate into Pass 7 for future extractions

  What This Enables

  With reproducibility infrastructure extracted, your rubrics can include objective, verifiable criteria:

  Replicability Rubric (excerpt):
  Data Availability (0-30 points):
  - No data availability statement: 0 points
  - Statement present but no links: 5 points
  - Links present but don't resolve: 10 points
  - Links resolve but no metadata: 15 points
  - Links resolve with minimal metadata: 20 points
  - Complete dataset with rich metadata: 25-30 points

  Code Availability (0-20 points):
  - No code availability statement: 0 points
  - Statement present but no code: 5 points
  - Code available but undocumented: 10 points
  - Code available with minimal docs: 15 points
  - Complete, documented, executable code: 18-20 points

  [etc.]

  Proposed Immediate Action Plan

  This Week:

  1. Define reproducibility infrastructure schema (2-3 hours)
    - Specify all fields to capture
    - Define structure for reproducibility_infrastructure.json
  2. Build extraction/scanning tool (4-6 hours)
    - Script to identify and extract open science markers
    - URL extraction and pattern matching
    - Link resolution verification (optional for now)
  3. Run on existing corpus (1-2 hours)
    - Generate reproducibility infrastructure files for all 10 papers
    - Review outputs for quality
  4. Then proceed to rubric development (next week)
    - With complete data landscape known
    - Rubrics can reference both intrinsic (CEM) and extrinsic (infrastructure) elements

  Quick Prototyping Approach

  We could start even simpler - a 30-minute exploratory scan of one paper (sobotkova-et-al-2024?) to:
  - Identify what repository links exist
  - Check what sections they appear in
  - See what patterns emerge
  - Validate that this is worthwhile before building infrastructure

  This would give us concrete examples to guide the schema design.

  My Question for You

  Would you like to:

  A) Start with a quick exploratory scan of 1-2 papers to see what's there and refine the approach?

  B) Jump straight to building the lightweight scanning tool with a defined schema?

  C) Actually, let's defer this and start rubric development now, come back to infrastructure scanning later?

  My instinct is Option A - spend 30 minutes examining sobotkova-et-al-2024 to see what reproducibility infrastructure
  exists, what sections it's in, and what patterns we can exploit. This will make the scanning tool much more targeted.

  What do you think?

> Let's take this in steps - go ahead and do the quick scan first, to see what we're working with. I have to admit my 
papers haven't always been as good re: reproducibility as I'd like, but Connor et al, Eftimoski et al, and Penske et al 
should be good ones to start with. I'd suggest also gathering funding and conflict of interest statements from the paper,
 and maybe some other FAIR indicators like:\
- Use of CReDIT-satement of author contributions\
- Presence of a power analysis for statistical papers (e.g. - perhaps there are a few key indicators like this? treatment
 of uncertainty perhaps? what do you think?)\
- All references are in bibliography\
I have something in this regard that may be of interest to you during planning - please take a look in 
docs/background-research/ at the TDCC SSH Challenge Grant application, and see if you can learn anything there. 

● Excellent - let me first look at that TDCC grant application to inform the scan, then explore those three papers.

  - Citations to datasets
  - Citations to software
  - Ethics approval mentions
  - Conflict-of-interest statements
  - Authorship credit statements
  - Links to preregistrations
