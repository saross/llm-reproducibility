> Hi CC, apologies, VS Code just crashed, here's what we were working on. We need to make section-handling in 
the workflow more flexible, as we are now about to extract information from all of the papers in 
input/queue.yaml.\
\
  What I found:
  - WORKFLOW.md has basic section grouping: "Abstract + Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion +
  Conclusion"
  - Pass 1 prompt (01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md) says "Section-by-Section Extraction" but has NO guidance
   about:
    - Scientific vs humanistic papers
    - The 1500-word rule for breaking sections
    - Thematic section handling
    - Natural break identification (~1000 words ± 250)
    - Combining Abstract+following section or Conclusion+preceding section

  The prompt files I checked:
  - ✅ 01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md - exists, but lacks this guidance
  - ✅ 03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md - exists (note: filename is "pass1a" not "pass1")
  - No matches for "1500", "humanistic", "thematic", or "scientific paper" in the prompts directory

  Implication: When I invoke the research-assessor skill and read these prompts, I won't have the section
  handling rules you just described unless:
  1. They're added to the prompts, OR
  2. I carry forward the guidance you've just given me in this conversation

  Question 2: Ancient Greek Text Handling

  Understood! I'll:
  - ✅ Ignore Ancient Greek text in block quotes (always has English translation)
  - ✅ Handle individual Greek words discussed in arguments contextually, doing my best
  - ✅ See how it goes with the Ross-2005 philology paper

  ---
  What Should We Do?

  I see three options:

  Option A: Proceed with your verbal guidance
  - I remember the rules you just stated
  - Apply them during extraction
  - Risk: guidance not formally documented in prompts for future runs

  Option B: Add section handling guidance to prompts first
  - Update the relevant prompts (Pass 1 and Pass 3) with this guidance
  - Then proceed with extraction
  - Benefit: properly documented for reproducibility

  Option C: Add to WORKFLOW.md instead
  - Put the guidance in the workflow doc (lighter touch)
  - Prompts reference workflow for section handling
  - Then proceed

  Which approach would you prefer?

> no, it won't be in prompts yet, we're only just now expanding beyond the original test paper, we should write
 this guidance out to WORKFLOW.md or to the two prompts calling for section-by-section analysis, whichever you 
prefer, so that I don't have to repeat it again. Also, I forgot to ask, before we write out this guidance, do 
you have any questions? Is it clear and actionable? 

● Good question - let me verify I understand the guidance correctly and identify any ambiguities:

  Clarity Questions:

  1. Combining Abstract with "following section"

  You said "combine Abstract with the following section" but WORKFLOW.md currently says "Abstract +
  Introduction".

  Question: Should I:
  - Option A: Always combine Abstract with whatever section comes next (Introduction, Background, etc.)?
  - Option B: Specifically look for Introduction and combine with that?
  - Option C: Combine Abstract with the next section ONLY if it's Introduction?

  (I'm assuming Option A based on your wording, but want to confirm)

  2. Handling sections >1500 words in structured papers

  For thematic sections in humanistic papers, you said "divide if >1500 words using a subsection or other
  natural break."

  Question: What if there are no clear subsections or natural breaks in a >1500 word section? Should I:
  - Option A: Create an artificial break at roughly 1500 words?
  - Option B: Keep the section intact (exceeding 1500)?
  - Option C: Search harder for a natural break (paragraph boundaries, topic shifts)?

  3. "Top-level section heading" with subsections

  You mentioned "text under a top-level section heading."

  Question: If a section has subsections (e.g., "3. Methods" with "3.1 Study Area", "3.2 Data Collection"), do
  I:
  - Option A: Treat the entire "3. Methods" as one unit (unless >1500 words total)?
  - Option B: Treat 3.1, 3.2, etc. as separate extraction units?
  - Option C: Combine subsections but be willing to break at subsection boundaries if >1500 words?

  (I'm assuming Option A/C, but want to confirm)

  4. Mixed conventional + thematic sections

  You mentioned papers with "thematic sections...sometimes mixed with more conventional sections like
  'Results'."

  Confirmation: I should apply conventional handling (combine Conclusion with preceding, etc.) to conventional
  sections, and thematic handling (break at 1500 words) to thematic sections, right?

  5. Where to document - my preference

  You asked which I prefer. My recommendation:

  Option B (my preference): Add to the two prompts directly
  - Why: The prompts are what I actively read during extraction
  - Where: Add a new "Section Handling" section early in Pass 1 and Pass 3 prompts
  - Bonus: Also add a summary to WORKFLOW.md with a note "See Pass 1/3 prompts for details"

  Alternative (also good): Add full guidance to WORKFLOW.md, have prompts reference it
  - Why: Single source of truth, avoid duplication
  - Tradeoff: Extra step during extraction (read workflow, then prompt)

  If guidance is clear:

  Once you answer these questions, the guidance will be actionable and I can draft the text for whichever
  location(s) you prefer.

  I've reviewed the current state. Here's where we are:

  Current Documentation

  WORKFLOW.md (extraction-system/staging/WORKFLOW.md):
  - Lines 35-68: Has basic section grouping (Abstract+Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion+Conclusion)
  - Line 68: Generic note about adjusting based on paper structure
  - Missing: All the flexible section-handling rules you described

  Pass 1 Prompt (01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md):
  - Line 236: Says "Section-by-Section Extraction"
  - Missing: Any guidance on what constitutes a section, when to break large sections, how to handle thematic
  papers

  Pass 3 Prompt (03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md):
  - Missing: Section-handling guidance

  The Gap We're Filling

  You described flexible section-handling rules for:
  - Scientific vs humanistic paper structures
  - 1500-word threshold for breaking sections
  - Natural break identification (~1000 words ± 250)
  - Abstract combination with following section (not just Introduction)
  - Thematic section handling in humanistic papers
  - Mixed conventional + thematic sections

  My 5 Clarifying Questions

  Before documenting this guidance, I asked questions about:
  1. Abstract combination (always with next section, or specifically Introduction?)
  2. Handling >1500 word sections without clear breaks
  3. Subsections and the 1500-word rule
  4. Mixed conventional + thematic section handling
  5. Where to document (my preference: prompts directly, with summary in WORKFLOW.md)

  ---
  Ready for your answers to these questions. Once clarified, I'll draft the guidance for the location(s) you
  prefer.

> 1. Combining Abstract with "following section"

  You said "combine Abstract with the following section" but WORKFLOW.md currently says "Abstract +
  Introduction".

  - Option A: Always combine Abstract with whatever section comes next (Introduction, Background, etc.)?\
\
Likewise for Conclusion, always combine it with the previous section, whatever it is named.\
\
  2. Handling sections >1500 words in structured papers

  For thematic sections in humanistic papers, you said "divide if >1500 words using a subsection or other
  natural break."

  Question: What if there are no clear subsections or natural breaks in a >1500 word section? Should I:

  - Option C+A: Search harder for a natural break (paragraph boundaries, topic shifts) and choose the best 
option, targeting sections of about 1000 words but allowing up to 1500 to find *some sort of* natural break. If
 the section is >1500 and has *no* natural breaks, split it in half, or into ca. 1000-word chunks (use 
paragraph breaks if nothing else). The generalised guidance here is: aim for sections of 1000 words. They can 
be shorter or longer, but make sure none are >1500 words; divide in the most natural place(s) available.\
\
ion heading" with subsections

  You mentioned "text under a top-level section heading."

  Question: If a section has subsections (e.g., "3. Methods" with "3.1 Study Area", "3.2 Data Collection"), do
  I:
  - Option A: Treat the entire "3. Methods" as one unit (unless >1500 words total)
  - Option C: Combine subsections but be willing to break at subsection boundaries if >1500 words

  (I'm assuming Option A/C, but want to confirm) - YES CONFIRMED\
\
  4. Mixed conventional + thematic sections

  You mentioned papers with "thematic sections...sometimes mixed with more conventional sections like
  'Results'."

  Confirmation: I should apply conventional handling (combine Conclusion with preceding, etc.) to conventional
  sections, and thematic handling (break at 1500 words) to thematic sections, right? - YES, CORRECT
\
  5. Where to document - my preference

  You asked which I prefer. My recommendation:

  Option B (my preference): Add to the two prompts directly
  - Why: The prompts are what I actively read during extraction
  - Where: Add a new "Section Handling" section early in Pass 1 and Pass 3 prompts
  - Bonus: Also add a summary to WORKFLOW.md with a note "See Pass 1/3 prompts for details"

 YES, implement your preference, with the 'bonus' summary in workflow.md (replacing any superceded guidance 
currently in that prompt).\

Does this answer your questions? Please share your plan for prompt upgrades. Remember we are trying to keep the
 prompts lean, so keep additions consice while accomplishing what we need to do. 

● Plan: Add Flexible Section-Handling Guidance

  Based on your answers, here's my plan to add concise section-handling guidance to the prompts and workflow
  documentation.

  Changes Summary

  Files to modify:
  1. extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md - Add "Section Handling" section
  2. extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md - Add "Section Handling" section
  3. extraction-system/staging/WORKFLOW.md - Replace lines 35-68 with concise summary

  Placement in prompts:
  - Insert new "Section Handling" section after "Your Task" and before "Extraction Philosophy" (~line 30 in
  both prompts)
  - Keep it brief: ~20-25 lines maximum per prompt

  Draft Content

  For Pass 1 & Pass 3 Prompts (identical section)

  ## Section Handling

  **Section-by-section extraction uses flexible section grouping based on paper structure.**

  ### Default Section Groups

  Extract in order, processing each group completely before moving to the next:

  1. **Abstract + following section** (Introduction, Background, etc.) - combined as one unit
  2. **Methods/Approach** - all subsections as one unit
  3. **Results** - all subsections as one unit
  4. **Conclusion + preceding section** (Discussion, etc.) - combined as one unit

  **Adjust to paper structure:** Scientific papers often follow this pattern. Humanistic papers may have
  thematic sections instead.

  ### Section Size Limits

  **Target ~1000 words per section. Maximum 1500 words.**

  If a section exceeds 1500 words, divide using natural breaks:
  - **First choice**: Subsection boundaries (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
  - **Second choice**: Topic shifts or thematic boundaries
  - **Third choice**: Paragraph boundaries at ~1000-word intervals
  - **Last resort**: Split into ~1000-word chunks at paragraph breaks

  **Aim for 1000 ± 500 words** - sections can be shorter or longer, but never >1500 words.

  ### Thematic Papers (Common in Humanities)

  Papers with thematic sections rather than conventional structure:
  - Treat each major thematic section as extraction unit
  - Apply 1500-word maximum rule using natural breaks
  - Mixed papers: Use conventional handling for conventional sections (Abstract, Conclusion), thematic handling
   for thematic content

  For WORKFLOW.md (replacing lines 35-68)

  ### Required Section Grouping (Pass 1 & Pass 3 ONLY)

  **MANDATORY SECTION GROUPS for liberal extraction passes (01, 03):**

  Execute each pass by processing section groups in order. Complete each group before moving to next:

  1. **Abstract + following section** - Combined as ONE unit (save to JSON after)
  2. **Methods/Approach** - All subsections as ONE unit (save to JSON after)
  3. **Results** - All subsections as ONE unit (save to JSON after)
  4. **Conclusion + preceding section** - Combined as ONE unit (save to JSON after)

  **Section size limits:** Target ~1000 words per section, maximum 1500 words. If section exceeds 1500 words,
  divide at natural breaks (subsections > topic shifts > paragraph boundaries).

  **Adapt to paper structure:** Scientific papers often follow this pattern. Humanistic papers may use thematic
   sections - apply 1500-word maximum to each thematic unit.

  **For detailed section handling guidance:** See "Section Handling" in prompts 01 and 03.

  **For rationalization passes (02, 05) and validation (06):**
  - Review all relevant extractions across entire paper
  - No section-by-section processing required

  **For implicit RDMAP pass (04):**
  - Scan across entire paper for implicit items
  - No section-by-section processing required

  Implementation Notes

  Conciseness achieved by:
  - Bullet-point format for clarity
  - Hierarchy of natural breaks (avoids lengthy explanation)
  - Explicit word count targets (1000 ± 500, max 1500)
  - Reference to prompts from WORKFLOW.md (avoid duplication)

  Key guidance preserved:
  - Abstract + following (not just Introduction)
  - Conclusion + preceding (not just Discussion)
  - 1500-word maximum with natural break hierarchy
  - Scientific vs humanistic paper handling
  - Mixed section handling

  Total addition:
  - ~25 lines per prompt (01 and 03)
  - ~18 lines in WORKFLOW.md (replacing ~34 current lines)
  - Net reduction in WORKFLOW.md length

  ---
  Does this plan address your needs while keeping the prompts lean?

> Yes, just two questions: (1) what is the difference between:   \
- **Third choice**: Paragraph boundaries at ~1000-word intervals AND
- **Last resort**: Split into ~1000-word chunks at paragraph breaks?\
(2) You've accomplished this very concisely, which I really appreciate, but can I confirm that guidance this 
brief will be actionable? 

● Excellent questions - let me address both:

  Question 1: Third Choice vs Last Resort

  You're absolutely right - those are redundant/confusing. I was trying to distinguish between:
  - "Paragraph boundary at a topic shift" vs "arbitrary paragraph boundary"

  But I didn't make that clear. Here's the clearer hierarchy:

  1. First choice: Subsection boundaries (3.1, 3.2 - authorial structure)
  2. Second choice: Topic shifts between paragraphs (conceptual boundaries, even without headers)
  3. Last resort: Any paragraph boundary (arbitrary split at ~1000-word intervals)

  The "third choice" and "last resort" should collapse into one clearer item.

  Question 2: Is This Actionable?

  That's the key question. The guidance is concise, but will I actually know what to do when extracting?

  I think it's actionable for the core rules:
  - ✅ Combine Abstract with next section (clear)
  - ✅ Combine Conclusion with previous section (clear)
  - ✅ 1500-word maximum (clear)
  - ✅ Target ~1000 words (clear)
  - ✅ Hierarchy of breaks (clear with fix above)

  Potential ambiguity:
  - ❓ "Thematic papers" - What does this look like in practice?
  - ❓ "Mixed papers" - How do I recognize when to switch between conventional and thematic handling?

  Options to improve actionability:

  Option A: Add 1-2 brief examples
  **Examples:**
  - Scientific paper: Abstract+Intro (800w) → Methods (1200w) → Results (split at 3.1/3.2 if >1500w) →
  Discussion+Conclusion (900w)
  - Humanistic paper: Abstract+Background (600w) → "Landscape and Identity" (1400w) → "Material Evidence"
  (split at topic shift if >1500w) → "Synthesis"+Conclusion (800w)

  Option B: Add a quick recognition test for thematic papers
  **Recognizing thematic papers:** Section headings describe themes/arguments rather than methods ("Landscape
  and Memory", "Cultural Continuity") rather than conventional structure ("Methods", "Results").

  Option C: Trust the concise version as-is and see how it performs in practice

  My instinct: The core rules are clear enough. If you want maximum actionability, Option B adds ~2 lines and
  helps with the "thematic vs conventional" recognition question. But Option C (current plan) is probably
  sufficient for an experienced LLM following prompts.

  Your call: Keep it as-is (with the redundancy fix), or add Option B for clarity?

> would it be simpler to disregard 'mixed' papers and just treat them as 'thematic' papers if they have 
thematic section? I'd like to accommodate the variability of papers (even 'scientific' ones) when, for example,
 you might encounter one or two non-standard section headings in an otherwise 'normal' paper. 

● Brilliant insight - yes, that's much simpler and more robust!

  Revised Approach: Drop Paper Type Classification

  Instead of classifying papers as "scientific/humanistic/mixed," just have one flexible rule set that handles 
  all papers:

  Simplified Rules

  1. Always combine:
    - Abstract + following section (whatever it's called)
    - Conclusion + preceding section (whatever it's called)
  2. Middle sections:
    - Treat each major section as an extraction unit
    - Combine subsections (3.1, 3.2, etc.) into their parent section
    - Apply 1500-word maximum to each unit
  3. If any unit >1500 words:
    - Divide using natural breaks (subsections > topic shifts > paragraph boundaries)

  This naturally handles:
  - ✅ Pure scientific papers (Abstract+Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion+Conclusion)
  - ✅ Pure thematic papers (Abstract+Background, Theme 1, Theme 2, Synthesis+Conclusion)
  - ✅ "Mixed" papers (Abstract+Intro, Methods, "Landscape Memory", Results, Discussion+Conclusion)
  - ✅ Weird edge cases (no special handling needed)

  No classification required. Just follow the structure the authors gave you.

  Revised Prompt Section (Much Simpler)

  ## Section Handling

  **Extract section-by-section using flexible grouping based on the paper's structure.**

  ### Default Grouping

  1. **Abstract + following section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)
  2. **Middle sections** - Each major section as one unit, combining subsections (save after each)
  3. **Conclusion + preceding section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)

  **Adapt to what the paper gives you.** If Methods section is called "Approach" or "Materials and Methods,"
  treat it as a middle section. If there's a thematic section like "Landscape and Memory," treat it as a middle
   section.

  ### Section Size Limits

  **Target ~1000 words per section. Maximum 1500 words.**

  If any section exceeds 1500 words, divide using natural breaks in this order:
  1. Subsection boundaries (3.1, 3.2, etc.)
  2. Topic shifts or paragraph boundaries with conceptual breaks
  3. Any paragraph boundary at ~1000-word intervals

  **Aim for sections of 1000 ± 500 words** - never >1500 words.

  Benefits:
  - Removes ~8 lines about paper types
  - Eliminates need to classify papers or sections
  - More robust to variability
  - Clearer mental model: "just follow the paper's structure with size limits"

  Does this feel right?

> ok, great suggestion! The only other guidance I might add is that when splitting a section >1500 words, aim 
to split it into roughly equal sized chunks (using the natural break closest to the middle). Oh, one other 
thing, will this approach accommodate papers with *no* sections? We have one like that in the current batch. 

● Excellent catches on both points!

  Addition 1: Equal Chunks When Splitting

  Current: "divide using natural breaks"
  Better: "divide into roughly equal chunks using the natural break closest to the midpoint (or thirds,
  quarters, etc.)"

  Example:
  - 2000-word section → split at natural break near 1000 words (not at 1500)
  - 3500-word section → split into 3 chunks at natural breaks near 1167 and 2333 words

  Addition 2: Papers Without Sections

  This is a real scenario (Ross-2005 philology paper could be like this). We need fallback guidance.

  Proposed addition:

  ### Papers Without Formal Sections

  If the paper lacks section headings:
  1. **Abstract** - Usually labeled even without other sections (combine with next ~1000 words)
  2. **Middle content** - Process in ~1000-word chunks using paragraph boundaries or thematic shifts
  3. **Conclusion** - Usually recognizable by concluding language (combine with previous ~1000 words)

  **If no Abstract/Conclusion identifiable:** Process entire paper in ~1000-word chunks using paragraph
  boundaries.

  Does this cover the edge case?

  The logic is: try to identify functional Abstract/Conclusion zones even without headings, then chunk the
  middle. Worst case: just chunk the whole thing at ~1000-word intervals.

  Should I incorporate both additions into the final plan?

> yes, incorporate these additions into the final plan, and we'll see how it goes. It might be good to also add
 some tracking, perhaps in an existing 'notes' field in the schema, so that we can review where you decide to 
chunk the papers and refine the prompts if the decisions are suboptimal.

> Sorry, could I ask for one more thing? In:\
\
 Document your section grouping decisions in `extraction_notes.section_extracted` after each section group:
 - Which sections were combined
 - Where splits occurred and why (word count, break type used)
 - Any unusual structural features\
\
Could I also get a word count of the section? I'd like to monitor if chunks are actually being divided up 
evenly, and this metadata might also help identify if there's a word count above a certain threshold where 
extraction quality declines. 

● Perfect addition! Word count tracking will give you good data on chunking quality and potential performance
  thresholds.

  Updated Tracking Section

  ### Tracking Section Decisions

  Document your section grouping decisions in `extraction_notes.section_extracted` after each section group:
  - Which sections were combined
  - **Word count of the section/chunk**
  - Where splits occurred and why (word count, break type used)
  - Any unusual structural features

  This enables prompt refinement based on chunking quality and extraction performance analysis.

  Example of what I'd write:
  "Abstract + Introduction combined (1,247 words). Methods section split at subsection 3.3 boundary into
  Methods 3.1-3.2 (982 words) and Methods 3.3-3.5 (1,104 words). Results processed as single unit (876 words).
  Discussion + Conclusion combined (1,389 words)."

  This will let you:
  - ✅ Verify chunks stay within limits
  - ✅ Check if splits are actually equal
  - ✅ Correlate word count with extraction quality
  - ✅ Identify optimal chunk size thresholds

● User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Add Flexible Section-Handling Guidance to Prompts

     Files to Modify

     1. extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md - Add "Section Handling" section
     2. extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md - Add "Section Handling" section  
     3. extraction-system/staging/WORKFLOW.md - Replace section grouping guidance (lines 35-68)

     Changes

     1. Pass 1 & Pass 3 Prompts (identical new section)

     Insert after "Your Task" section, before extraction philosophy (~line 30):

     ## Section Handling

     **Extract section-by-section using flexible grouping based on the paper's structure.**

     ### Default Grouping

     1. **Abstract + following section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)
     2. **Middle sections** - Each major section as one unit, combining subsections (save after each)
     3. **Conclusion + preceding section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)

     **Adapt to what the paper gives you.** If Methods is called "Approach" or a section is thematic like 
     "Landscape and Memory," treat it as a middle section.

     ### Section Size Limits

     **Target ~1000 words per section. Maximum 1500 words.**

     If any section exceeds 1500 words, divide into roughly equal chunks using natural breaks:
     1. Subsection boundaries (3.1, 3.2, etc.) closest to midpoint/thirds
     2. Topic shifts or conceptual paragraph boundaries closest to equal division
     3. Any paragraph boundary closest to equal chunk sizes

     **Aim for 1000 ± 500 words per chunk** - never >1500 words.

     ### Papers Without Formal Sections

     If the paper lacks section headings:
     1. **Abstract** - Usually labeled even without sections (combine with next ~1000 words)
     2. **Middle content** - Process in ~1000-word chunks using paragraph/thematic boundaries
     3. **Conclusion** - Recognizable by concluding language (combine with previous ~1000 words)

     If no Abstract/Conclusion identifiable: Process entire paper in ~1000-word chunks.

     ### Tracking Section Decisions

     Document your section grouping decisions in `extraction_notes.section_extracted` after each section group:
     - Which sections were combined
     - **Word count of the section/chunk**
     - Where splits occurred and why (word count, break type used)
     - Any unusual structural features

     This enables prompt refinement and extraction performance analysis.

     - No section-by-section processing required

     **For implicit RDMAP pass (04):**
     - Scan across entire paper
     - No section-by-section processing required

     Summary

     - Simplified approach: No paper-type classification, flexible rules adapt to any structure
     - Size limits: 1000-word target, 1500-word maximum, equal chunks when splitting
     - Edge case handled: Papers without formal sections
     - Tracking added: Document chunking decisions with word counts in extraction_notes.section_extracted
     - Concise: ~32 lines in prompts, ~25 lines in WORKFLOW (net reduction overall)

       32 +  ## Section Handling
       33 +  
       34 +  **Extract section-by-section using flexible grouping based on the paper's structure.**
       35 +  
       36 +  ### Default Grouping
       37 +  
       38 +  1. **Abstract + following section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)
       39 +  2. **Middle sections** - Each major section as one unit, combining subsections (save after 
          + each)
       40 +  3. **Conclusion + preceding section** - Combined as one unit (save to JSON after)
       41 +  
       42 +  **Adapt to what the paper gives you.** If Methods is called "Approach" or a section is thematic
          +  like "Landscape and Memory," treat it as a middle section.
       43 +  
       44 +  ### Section Size Limits
       45 +  
       46 +  **Target ~1000 words per section. Maximum 1500 words.**
       47 +  
       48 +  If any section exceeds 1500 words, divide into roughly equal chunks using natural breaks:
       49 +  1. Subsection boundaries (3.1, 3.2, etc.) closest to midpoint/thirds
       50 +  2. Topic shifts or conceptual paragraph boundaries closest to equal division
       51 +  3. Any paragraph boundary closest to equal chunk sizes
       52 +  
       53 +  **Aim for 1000 ± 500 words per chunk** - never >1500 words.
       54 +  
       55 +  ### Papers Without Formal Sections
       56 +  
       57 +  If the paper lacks section headings:
       58 +  1. **Abstract** - Usually labelled even without sections (combine with next ~1000 words)
       59 +  2. **Middle content** - Process in ~1000-word chunks using paragraph/thematic boundaries
       60 +  3. **Conclusion** - Recognisable by concluding language (combine with previous ~1000 words)
       61 +  
       62 +  If no Abstract/Conclusion identifiable: Process entire paper in ~1000-word chunks.
       63 +  
       64 +  ### Tracking Section Decisions
       65 +  
       66 +  Document your section grouping decisions in `extraction_notes.section_extracted` after each 
          + section group:
       67 +  - Which sections were combined
       68 +  - **Word count of the section/chunk**
       69 +  - Where splits occurred and why (word count, break type used)
       70 +  - Any unusual structural features
       71 +  
       72 +  This enables prompt refinement and extraction performance analysis.

       63    **IMPORTANT - Direct writes only:**

● Section-Handling Guidance Updated

  All three files have been successfully updated with the flexible section-handling guidance.

  What Changed

  1. Pass 1 Prompt (01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  - Added comprehensive "Section Handling" section after line 30
  - Includes: default grouping, size limits, papers without sections, tracking requirements
  - 43 lines added

  2. Pass 3 Prompt (03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md)
  - Added identical "Section Handling" section after line 40
  - Same content as Pass 1 for consistency
  - 43 lines added

  3. WORKFLOW.md
  - Replaced lines 35-68 (34 lines) with concise summary (25 lines)
  - Net reduction: 9 lines
  - References prompts for detailed guidance

  Key Features Implemented

  ✅ Flexible structure handling - No paper-type classification needed
  ✅ Size limits - 1000-word target, 1500-word maximum
  ✅ Equal chunk splitting - Divide at natural breaks closest to midpoint/thirds
  ✅ Papers without sections - Fallback guidance for unsectioned papers
  ✅ Word count tracking - Required documentation in extraction_notes.section_extracted

  Tracking Format

  When I extract from papers, I'll now document:
  - Which sections were combined
  - Word count of each section/chunk
  - Where splits occurred and why
  - Unusual structural features

  This will give you data to monitor chunking quality and identify performance thresholds.
