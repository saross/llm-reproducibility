> /compact   I've created both documents for smooth handover:

  1. Complete Assessment (Already Saved)

  Location: planning/skill-content-assessment.md
  - Detailed 10-part analysis with examples
  - All duplication issues documented
  - File-by-file quality ratings
  - Comprehensive recommendations

  2. Compact Handover Message

  Location: /tmp/compact-message.md
  - Concise summary of 3 priority levels
  - Specific line numbers and changes needed
  - Implementation checklist
  - Expected outcomes (SKILL.md: 268 → 192 lines)

  Key Findings Summary

  🔴 Priority 1 (Critical): 76 lines of duplication in SKILL.md
  - RDMAP Hierarchy (19 lines) → duplicates tier-assignment-guide.md
  - Consolidation Algorithm (44 lines) → duplicates consolidation-patterns.md
  - Violates skill-creator principle: "Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both"

  🟡 Priority 2 (Important): 4 distribution/navigation fixes
  - Rename research-design-extraction-guide.md
  - Add to SKILL.md navigation
  - Fix 2 incorrect filename references

  Estimated refactoring: 1-2 hours, LOW risk (pointer updates only)

  The handover message in /tmp/compact-message.md has everything needed to resume and implement the fixes efficiently.

> welcome back, I'd like to plan implementation of the improvements in plannnig/skill-content-assessement.md. BEFORE we implement
 those changes, however, I'd like you to review the five extractions prompts in extractons-system/prompts/ (01-05, EXCLUDING 
AQ-QI_PROMPT.v3.md). I'd like you to check: (a) after the proposed changes, *do any of the references to the skill in the prompts
 need to be updated*? (b) is the skill *always* referenced and referenced correctly where it should be? (c) are their 
opportunities to reference the skill where it is not yet referenced? invoke the skill-creator skill as you conduct this review. 

● I'll review the extraction prompts to check how they reference the skill, and whether any updates are needed after the proposed
   refactoring. Let me start by reading the handover message to understand the proposed changes, then examine all 5 prompts.

● Read(/tmp/compact-message.md)
  ⎿  Read 185 lines

● Search(pattern: "extraction-system/prompts/0*.md")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

> The "skill-creator" skill is loading 

● I'll review all 5 extraction prompts to analyze how they reference the research-assessor skill and whether any updates are
  needed. Let me read each prompt systematically.

● Read(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 341 lines

● Read(extraction-system/prompts/02-claims-evidence_pass2_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 419 lines

● Read(extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 590 lines

● Read(extraction-system/prompts/04-rdmap_pass2_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 551 lines

● Read(extraction-system/prompts/05-rdmap_pass3_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 507 lines

● Now let me read the full skill content assessment to understand the complete context of the proposed changes.

● Read(planning/skill-content-assessment.md)
  ⎿  Read 642 lines

● Perfect, I now have complete context. Let me analyze all 5 extraction prompts against the proposed skill refactoring changes to
   answer your three questions comprehensively.

Recommendation: Implement Phase 1 (required updates) alongside the skill refactoring. Phase 2 (enhancements) can be done after
 refactoring to take advantage of new skill content.\
\
Please implement 

● Perfect! I'll implement Phase 1 (required updates) alongside the skill refactoring. Let me create a task list and then execute
  all changes.

● I see there's a conflict - you've asked me to implement, but I'm still in plan mode. Would you like me to:

  1. Exit plan mode and proceed with implementation - I'll execute all Phase 1 updates (prompt fixes + skill refactoring)
  immediately
  2. Present a final implementation plan for confirmation - Show you exactly what will change before executing

  Which would you prefer?

> I've exited plan mode for us - please proceed with implementation 

● Perfect! Let me proceed with Phase 1 implementation. I'll start with the prompt updates, then move to the skill refactoring.

       168    ### Consolidation Logic
       169    
       170 -  **PRIMARY: Empirical Graph Analysis (Identical Support Patterns)**
       170 +  Evidence items with **identical claim support patterns** that are **never cited independently** should be 
           + consolidated.
       171    
       172 -  For assessment-focused extraction, evidence items that are always used together should be consolidated.
       173 -  
       174 -  **The Rule:** If evidence items have identical claim support patterns and are never cited independently → 
           - CONSOLIDATE
       175 -  
       176 -  **How to identify:**
       177 -  1. Map each evidence item to claims it supports: `E001 → [C003, C005]`
       178 -  2. Find items with identical support patterns: `E002 → [C003, C005]`
       179 -  3. Verify neither item is cited independently in other claims
       180 -  4. If patterns match and no independent citations → consolidate as compound finding
       181 -  5. Document with consolidation_type: `identical_support_pattern`
       182 -  
       183 -  **Example:**
       184 -  ```
       185 -  E032 → [C063] only
       186 -  E033 → [C063] only
       187 -  → Identical patterns, never cited separately
       188 -  → CONSOLIDATE as compound finding
       189 -  ```
       190 -  
       191 -  **Rationale:** For credibility assessment, what matters is the analytical unit. If E001 and E002 are never 
           - assessed separately—always invoked together as joint support—they function as a single analytical unit and should
           -  be consolidated.
       192 -  
       193 -  **SECONDARY: Assessment Compatibility Test**
       194 -  
       195 -  When empirical graph analysis is inconclusive (e.g., no claim support, complex patterns), ask:
       196 -  
       197 -  *"Would I assess the credibility of these items TOGETHER or SEPARATELY?"*
       198 -  
       199 -  - Together → Consider consolidation
       200 -  - Separately → Keep distinct
       201 -  
       202 -  **Common patterns:**
       203 -  - Multiple rationales for same decision → Together
       204 -  - Problem + solution narrative → Together
       205 -  - Temporal comparisons (2017 vs 2018) → Separately (ALWAYS)
       206 -  - Different assessment implications → Separately
       207 -  
       208 -  **CRITICAL:** Temporal comparisons always separate—comparison requires distinct items, even if they have 
           - identical support patterns.
       209 -  
       210 -  **For detailed patterns, examples, and edge cases:**

  Next Steps

  Phase 2 (Enhancement Opportunities) - Ready to implement when you'd like:
  - Add cross-reference repair procedure references to Pass 2 prompts
  - Add implicit RDMAP patterns reference to Pass 1 prompt
  - Add template script references for concrete examples
  - Enhance consolidation-patterns.md references with section specificity

  Would you like me to proceed with Phase 2 enhancements now, or shall we test the Phase 1 changes first?

> Yes, please proceed with Phase 2 enhancements 

● Perfect! I'll now implement Phase 2 enhancements to add explicit references to the new skill content created in v2.6.3. Let me
  update the task list and proceed.

● Update(extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md)
  ⎿  Updated extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md with 3 additions

● Phase 2 Enhancements Complete! ✅

  All enhancement opportunities have been successfully implemented and pushed. Here's what was added:

  ---
  Enhancement Summary by Prompt

  01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md

  Added: Template script reference (lines 260-261)
  **For concrete examples with proper sourcing structure:**
  → See extraction-system/scripts/extraction/section_implicit_arguments_template.py (4 worked examples, one per type)
  Benefit: Users now have concrete examples showing exact trigger_text/trigger_locations structure for all 4 implicit argument
  types

  ---
  02-claims-evidence_pass2_prompt.md

  Added: Cross-reference repair procedure (after STEP 3)
  🚨 CRITICAL: Cross-Reference Repair After Consolidation

  When consolidating items, cross-references in OTHER arrays must be updated
  to point to the new consolidated IDs. This is MANDATORY to prevent broken references.

  For complete cross-reference repair procedure (including algorithm and validation):
  → See references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md (Cross-Reference Repair After Consolidation section, lines 411-520)
  Benefit: Prevents the 41 broken cross-references issue from recurring; explicit CRITICAL flag ensures it won't be overlooked

  ---
  03-rdmap_pass1_prompt.md

  Added: Implicit RDMAP patterns reference (after Step 0)
  **For systematic implicit RDMAP recognition patterns:**
  → See references/extraction-fundamentals.md (Implicit RDMAP Extraction section)
  - Covers 4 recognition patterns: Mentioned Procedure, Effects Implying Causes, Mentions Without Descriptions, Strategic
  Decisions
  - Section-by-section extraction workflow for finding implicit RDMAP items
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  Benefit: Directly addresses the 0 implicit RDMAP items regression; makes v2.6.3 patterns discoverable at the critical
  extraction point

  ---
  04-rdmap_pass2_prompt.md

  Enhanced: Consolidation patterns reference (line 119)
  **For detailed patterns and examples:**
  → See consolidation-patterns.md (RDMAP Consolidation Patterns section)
  Benefit: Section specificity helps navigate 529-line file efficiently

  Added: Cross-reference repair procedure (after STEP 3)
  🚨 CRITICAL: Cross-Reference Repair After Consolidation
  [Same as Claims Pass 2 - parallel structure]
  Benefit: Ensures RDMAP consolidations also trigger cross-reference repair; parallel to Claims Pass 2 for consistency

  ---

  Complete Implementation Summary

  Phase 1 ✅ (Completed Earlier)

  - Skill refactoring (SKILL.md: 268 → 194 lines, 28% reduction)
  - Required prompt updates (filename changes, path fixes)
  - File rename (research-design-extraction-guide.md → research-design-operational-guide.md)

  Phase 2 ✅ (Just Completed)

  - Cross-reference repair procedure references (2 prompts)
  - Implicit pattern recognition references (2 prompts)
  - Template script references (1 prompt)
  - Section-specific navigation enhancements (1 prompt)

  Status: All planned improvements implemented and deployed! 🎉

  The research-assessor skill and extraction prompts are now:
  - 100% skill-creator compliant
  - Cross-reference aware (prevents broken refs)
  - Implicit-extraction robust (v2.6.3 patterns discoverable)
  - Template-enriched (concrete examples available)

  Would you like me to create documentation summarising these changes, or shall we move on to testing the updated prompts?

> was there a small 'Phase 3' standardisation task we still needed to do? 

● Yes! Good catch. There's a Phase 3: Optional Standardisation task we identified:

  Standardise path references across all prompts - Convert absolute paths (/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/...) to
  relative paths (references/...) for consistency with skill-creator best practices.

  Let me check which prompts still have absolute paths:

● Bash(grep -n "/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor" extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md
      extraction-system/prompts/02-claims-evidence_pass2_pro…)

  Perfect! All planned work is complete. The skill and prompts are now optimally structured and fully documented. 🎉

> ok, this is great work. While you have this knowledge in context, I'd like you to scan the five prompts and look for any 
opportunities to move content to the improved skill. Invoke the skill-creator skill, and optimise division between prompts and 
skill. 

● Excellent idea! Let me invoke the skill-creator skill and systematically analyze all 5 prompts for content that should be moved
   to the skill. I'll look for duplication, conceptual content, and decision frameworks that belong in references rather than
  prompts.

> The "skill-creator" skill is loading 

● Perfect! Now I'll systematically analyze all 5 prompts using skill-creator principles. Let me examine each prompt for content
  that should be in the skill instead.

● Bash(wc -l extraction-system/prompts/01-claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md
      extraction-system/prompts/02-claims-evidence_pass2_prompt.md extraction-system/prompts/03-rdm…)

● Prompt-to-Skill Optimization Analysis Complete! 📊

  I've completed a comprehensive analysis using skill-creator principles and identified significant optimization opportunities.
  Here's what I found:

  ---
  Key Findings

  🔴 CRITICAL: 89 Lines of Duplication

  Content exists in BOTH prompts AND skill:

  1. Evidence vs Claims (30 lines) - In SKILL.md AND Prompt 01
  2. RDMAP Hierarchy Decision Tree (39 lines) - In tier-assignment-guide.md AND Prompt 03
  3. Tier Definitions (20 lines) - In tier-assignment-guide.md AND Prompt 04

  Violates: "Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both"

  ---
  🟡 HIGH PRIORITY: 204 Lines of Conceptual Frameworks

  Decision frameworks currently in prompts that belong in skill:

  1. Claims Hierarchy (22 lines) - 4-level structure (Core/Intermediate/Supporting/Evidence)
  2. Multi-Dimensional Evidence Pattern (35 lines) - Consolidation decision framework
  3. Description vs Argumentation Boundary (17 lines) - RDMAP vs Claims distinction
  4. Reasoning Approach Classification (29 lines) - Inductive/Abductive/Deductive/Mixed
  5. Research Questions vs Hypotheses (21 lines) - RQ vs hypothesis distinction
  6. Fieldwork Considerations (20 lines) - Opportunistic decisions, emergent patterns
  7. RDMAP Consolidation Patterns (45 lines) - 6 RDMAP-specific consolidation patterns
  8. Reasoning Verification (15 lines) - How to verify reasoning approaches

  Your Decision

  Would you like me to:

  Option A: Implement Phase A (Quick Wins - remove duplications) immediately?
  Option B: Implement Phases A + B (full optimization) in one go?
  Option C: Review the full analysis document first before deciding?

  The analysis is ready - I can start implementation as soon as you give the go-ahead!

> We are running low on context, so I will need you to create a /compact message that will ensure a smooth transition to our next
 session. As you do so, could you please add a couple of preliminary tasks? I am eager to realise these gains, but worry about 
risk, especially loss of fidelity / comprehensiveness. Could you please add a task to confirm and elaborate risk levels? Looking 
at the skills-creator skill, what is the guideance for division between prompt and skill (not skill.md and references)? My 
inclination will be to implement the 'low-risk' changes first, then consider the 'medium-risk' change. Don't implement any of 
this yet, please just compose a /compact message and we'll continue after compacting.

        18 -  1. **🔴 CRITICAL - Content Duplication (P1)**:
        19 -     - RDMAP Hierarchy (19 lines in SKILL.md) duplicates tier-assignment-guide.md
        20 -     - Consolidation Algorithm (44 lines in SKILL.md) duplicates consolidation-patterns.md

        19    
        20 -  2. **🟡 IMPORTANT - Distribution Issues (P2)**:
        21 -     - research-design-extraction-guide.md not in SKILL.md navigation (line 109)
        22 -     - Should rename to research-design-operational-guide.md for clarity
        23 -     - Schema examples/ referenced but doesn't exist (SKILL.md line 106)
        24 -     - Filename mismatch: "sobotkova-methods.md" → actual is "sobotkova-example.md" (line 114)
        20 +  ---
        21    
        22 -  3. **🟢 OPTIONAL - Symmetry (P3)**:
        23 -     - Consider creating claims-evidence-operational-guide.md (parallel to research-design-operational-guide.md)
        22 +  ## Risk Assessment Needed (PRELIMINARY TASKS)

        62 -  ```markdown
        63 -  # OPTION A - Keep as-is (it's already lean, 13 lines)
        64 -  # OPTION B - Create references/checklists/evidence-vs-claims-guide.md and reduce to pointer
        65 -  # RECOMMENDATION: Keep as-is (core principle, lean enough)
        61 +  1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
        62 +  2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
        63 +  3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
        64 +  4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks
        65    ```
        66    
        67 -  **Result**: SKILL.md shrinks from 268 → ~192 lines (28% reduction)
        67 +  **Architecture note from current SKILL.md:**
        68 +  ```
        69 +  This skill provides:
        70 +  - Core decision frameworks (how to distinguish evidence/claims, assign tiers, consolidate items)
        71 +  - Schema definitions (object structures, field requirements)
        72 +  - Reference materials (checklists, examples)
        73    
        74 +  The user provides:
        75 +  - Extraction prompts (detailed instructions for each pass, provided at runtime)
        76 +  - Source material (research paper sections to extract from)
        77 +  - JSON document (template or partially populated from previous passes)
        78 +  
        79 +  Why this separation? Extraction prompts evolve frequently through testing and refinement.
        80 +  This architecture allows prompt tuning without modifying the skill package, minimizing versioning conflicts.
        81 +  ```
        82 +  
        83 +  **Need to clarify**: Does this mean conceptual frameworks SHOULD be in skill, and only pass-specific 
           + orchestration in prompts?

        87 -  ### Priority 2: Fix Distribution Issues
        87 +  ## Proposed Phased Approach (After Risk Assessment)
        88    
        89 -  **Change 1** - Rename file:
        90 -  ```bash
        91 -  mv .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/research-design-extraction-guide.md \
        92 -     .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/research-design-operational-guide.md
        93 -  ```
        89 +  ### Phase A: Low-Risk Changes (If confirmed as low-risk)
        90    
        91 -  **Change 2** - Update SKILL.md navigation (around line 109):
        92 -  ```markdown
        93 -  # CURRENT:
        94 -  **Decision Frameworks:**
        95 -  - `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` - Design vs Method vs Protocol decisions
        96 -  - `references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md` - When to lump vs split items, cross-reference repair 
           - procedure (CRITICAL for Pass 2 & Pass 4)
        97 -  - `references/checklists/expected-information.md` - Domain-specific completeness checklists
        91 +  **Duplications to remove** (content exists in multiple places):
        92 +  1. Evidence vs Claims (30 lines) - Remove from SKILL.md + Prompt 01 → Create evidence-vs-claims-guide.md
        93 +  2. RDMAP Hierarchy decision tree (39 lines) - Remove from Prompt 03 → Reference tier-assignment-guide.md
        94 +  3. Tier definitions verification (20 lines) - Remove from Prompt 04 → Reference tier-assignment-guide.md
        95    
        96 -  # ADD AFTER tier-assignment-guide.md:
        97 -  - `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` - Operational patterns for finding all Research Designs (4-6
           -  expected)
        98 -  ```
        96 +  **Why low-risk**: Not removing content, just consolidating. Content still accessible via references.
        97    
        98 -  **Change 3** - Fix schema examples reference (line 106):
        99 -  ```markdown
       100 -  # CURRENT:
       101 -  **Schema & Structure:**
       102 -  - `references/schema/schema-guide.md` - Complete object definitions
       103 -  - `references/schema/examples/` - JSON examples from real extractions
        98 +  **Test**: Verify references resolve, run sample extraction
        99    
       100 -  # CHANGE TO:
       101 -  **Schema & Structure:**
       102 -  - `references/schema/schema-guide.md` - Complete object definitions with inline examples
       103 -  ```
       100 +  ### Phase B: Medium-Risk Changes (If risk acceptable after assessment)
       101    
       102 -  **Change 4** - Fix filename reference (line 114):
       103 -  ```markdown
       104 -  # CURRENT:
       105 -  **Examples:**
       106 -  - `references/examples/sobotkova-methods.md` - Complete worked example
       102 +  **Conceptual frameworks to move** (8 candidates, 204 lines):
       103 +  - Claims Hierarchy (22 lines)
       104 +  - Multi-Dimensional Evidence Pattern (35 lines)
       105 +  - Description vs Argumentation Boundary (17 lines)
       106 +  - Reasoning Approach Classification (29 lines)
       107 +  - Research Questions vs Hypotheses (21 lines)

       111    
       112 -  # CHANGE TO:
       113 -  **Examples:**
       114 -  - `references/examples/sobotkova-example.md` - Complete worked example
       115 -  ```
       112 +  **Why medium-risk**: Need elaboration. Possibly:
       113 +  - More content to migrate carefully
       114 +  - Need to ensure prompts remain functional
       115 +  - Risk of making prompts too abstract?
       116    
       117 +  **Need to determine**: Can we further split Phase B into low-risk and medium-risk subsets?
       118 +  
       119 +  ### Phase C: Optional Polish (Low-risk)
       120 +  
       121 +  **Pattern to add**:
       122 +  - Calculation Claims Pattern (20 lines) → Add to consolidation-patterns.md

       141 +  ## Completed Work (Phases 1-3)
       142 +  
       143 +  ### Phase 1: Skill Refactoring (Commit: de01612)
       144 +  - ✅ Removed 76 lines duplication from SKILL.md (268 → 194 lines, 28% reduction)
       145 +  - ✅ Fixed 4 filename/path references in prompts
       146 +  - ✅ Renamed research-design-extraction-guide.md → research-design-operational-guide.md
       147 +  
       148 +  ### Phase 2: Prompt Enhancements (Commit: a24b50c)
       149 +  - ✅ Added cross-reference repair procedure references (Prompts 02, 04)
       150 +  - ✅ Added implicit RDMAP patterns reference (Prompt 03)
       151 +  - ✅ Added implicit arguments template reference (Prompt 01)
       152 +  - ✅ Enhanced consolidation-patterns.md reference specificity
       153 +  
       154 +  ### Phase 3: Path Standardisation (Commit: 014d59d)
       155 +  - ✅ Standardised 8 absolute paths to relative paths across 5 prompts
       156 +  - ✅ Improved consistency and portability
       157 +  
       158 +  **Status**: All skill-creator compliance work complete. Skill is 100% compliant, prompts reference skill 
           + correctly.
       159 +  
       160 +  **Now ready for**: Prompt-to-skill content migration (pending risk assessment)

       164 -  ## Expected Outcomes
       164 +  ## Next Session Tasks
       165    
       166 -  **After refactoring**:
       167 -  - ✅ SKILL.md: 268 → ~192 lines (properly lean per skill-creator)
       168 -  - ✅ Zero duplication between SKILL.md and references
       169 -  - ✅ All reference files properly listed in navigation
       170 -  - ✅ 100% skill-creator compliant
       171 -  - ✅ Easier maintenance (single source of truth for each concept)
       166 +  ### BEFORE Implementation:
       167    
       168 -  **Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours
       169 -  **Risk**: LOW (removal/pointer updates only, no content modification)
       168 +  **Task 1**: Elaborate risk assessment
       169 +  - Review planning/prompt-to-skill-optimization.md in detail
       170 +  - Assess each recommendation for fidelity/comprehensiveness risks
       171 +  - Identify concrete mitigations
       172 +  - Categorise as truly "low-risk" vs "medium-risk" vs "high-risk"
       173 +  - Determine if Phase B can be split into safer subsets
       174    
       175 +  **Task 2**: Clarify skill-creator guidance on prompt vs skill division
       176 +  - Extract principles from skill-creator skill
       177 +  - Apply to current architecture
       178 +  - Validate that proposed moves align with principles
       179 +  - Answer: Should conceptual frameworks be in skill? Should prompts be workflow-only?
       180 +  
       181 +  **Task 3**: Present revised phased approach
       182 +  - Based on risk assessment and skill-creator principles
       183 +  - Start with confirmed low-risk changes only
       184 +  - Provide detailed plan for medium-risk changes with mitigations
       185 +  
       186 +  ### AFTER Risk Assessment and User Approval:
       187 +  
       188 +  **Task 4**: Implement approved low-risk changes
       189 +  - Create new reference files as needed
       190 +  - Remove content from prompts
       191 +  - Add clear references in prompts
       192 +  - Test: Verify references resolve correctly
       193 +  
       194 +  **Task 5**: Test with full extraction
       195 +  - Run complete 5-pass extraction on test paper
       196 +  - Verify no functionality lost
       197 +  - Check comprehensiveness maintained
       198 +  
       199 +  **Task 6**: Implement approved medium-risk changes (if approved)
       200 +  - Follow same process as Task 4
       201 +  - More careful testing
       202 +  - Incremental implementation if possible
       203 +

       206 -  ## Files to Modify
       206 +  ## Key Questions for User
       207    
       208 -  1. `.claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md` - Remove duplication, fix references
       209 -  2. `.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/research-design-extraction-guide.md` - Rename
       210 -  3. `extraction-system/skill/research-assessor/` - Sync after changes
       208 +  1. **Risk tolerance**: How risk-averse are you? Should we be very conservative (only remove duplications) or 
           + moderately progressive (also move clear conceptual frameworks)?
       209    
       210 +  2. **Testing approach**: Do you have a test paper we can use for validation after changes? Or should we test on 
           + Sobotkova et al. 2023?
       211 +  
       212 +  3. **Incremental vs batch**: Implement one change at a time with testing, or batch low-risk changes together?
       213 +  
       214 +  4. **Medium-risk Phase B**: After risk assessment, if Phase B looks riskier than expected, should we skip it or 
           + find ways to de-risk it?

       254 +  ## User's Last Instruction
       255 +  
       256 +  > "I am eager to realise these gains, but worry about risk, especially loss of fidelity/comprehensiveness. Could
           +  you please add a task to confirm and elaborate risk levels? Looking at the skills-creator skill, what is the 
           + guidance for division between prompt and skill (not skill.md and references)? My inclination will be to implement
           +  the 'low-risk' changes first, then consider the 'medium-risk' change. Don't implement any of this yet, please 
           + just compose a /compact message and we'll continue after compacting."
       257 +  
       258 +  **Action taken**: Created this compact message with preliminary tasks for risk assessment and skill-creator 
           + guidance clarification. No implementation performed.
       259 +  
       260 +  **Next step**: After compacting, start with Tasks 1-2 (risk assessment and guidance clarification) before any 
           + implementation.

● Perfect! I've created the compact handover message at /tmp/compact-message.md (261 lines).

  What's in the Handover

  Summary of Work Completed:
  - ✅ All Phases 1-3 complete (skill refactoring, enhancements, standardisation)
  - ✅ Comprehensive analysis of prompts → skill optimization opportunities
  - ✅ 313 lines identified for potential migration (13% prompt reduction)

  Preliminary Tasks Added (as requested):

  Task 1: Elaborate Risk Assessment
  - Detailed analysis of what makes each change "low" vs "medium" risk
  - Specific fidelity/comprehensiveness risks
  - Concrete mitigations
  - Can Phase B be split into safer subsets?

  Task 2: Skill-Creator Guidance on Prompt vs Skill Division
  - Extract principles from skill-creator skill
  - Clarify: What belongs in prompts vs skill?
  - Validate proposed moves against principles
  - Answer: Should conceptual frameworks be in skill, prompts workflow-only?

  Phased Approach:
  - Phase A: Low-risk (duplications) - 89 lines
  - Phase B: Medium-risk (frameworks) - 204 lines - needs risk elaboration
  - Phase C: Optional - 20 lines

  Key Documents for Next Session:
  1. planning/prompt-to-skill-optimization.md (642 lines) - CRITICAL to read
  2. planning/skill-content-assessment.md (642 lines) - Context

  Next Steps:
  1. Compact the session
  2. Resume with Tasks 1-2 (risk assessment + guidance clarification)
  3. Then implement only approved low-risk changes

  The handover ensures we can pick up exactly where we left off with proper risk assessment before any implementation!
