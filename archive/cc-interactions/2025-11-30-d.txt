> Huh, I'll review the summary in more depth, but in what sense was 
ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 advocacy? 

● Good question - and on reflection, "advocacy" was probably the wrong
  framing.

  I applied the ⚠️ flag because the paper presents FAIMS as a solution
  without systematically comparing alternatives, which led to a moderate
  Robustness score (55). But that's conflating two things:

  1. What I meant: The paper doesn't test FAIMS against alternative
  approaches (commercial tools, other platforms, ad-hoc solutions), so
  Robustness is limited in the traditional sense.
  2. What "advocacy" implies: A paper arguing for a position in a way that
  might bias evidence presentation.

  A SoftwareX software description paper isn't "advocacy" - it's doing
  exactly what the journal expects: describing software architecture,
  features, and use cases. You wouldn't expect a software paper to include a
   systematic comparison study; that would be a different paper type
  entirely.

  The moderate Robustness score might still be defensible (the paper doesn't
   provide sensitivity analysis or systematic comparison), but labelling it
  "advocacy" carries connotations that don't fit. A fairer characterisation
  would be:

  Software description paper - Robustness assessed against software paper 
  expectations, not empirical study standards. Limited comparison to 
  alternatives is typical for the genre, not a bias concern.

  I should revise the flag system to distinguish:
  - ⚠️ Advocacy - genuinely arguing a position (e.g., a methods paper
  promoting a technique)
  - 🔧 Software paper - describing software (different Robustness
  expectations)

  Would you like me to update the assessment files to correct this framing?

> No, I'm happy with that assessment, but let's try to make sure that the 
context you provided here makes it into the final report - I'd expect 
similar results from many software or data papers. 

● Understood. I'll update the ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 assessment files to
   properly contextualise this for software/data papers.

       146 -  ### Robustness (55, Moderate) ⚠️
       146 +  ### Robustness (55, Moderate) 📦
       147    
       148 -  **Why this score:** Methodological advocacy papers argue 
           - for a position rather than systematically testing 
           - alternatives. A Moderate Robustness score is typical — and 
           - not a severe criticism — for this paper type.
       148 +  **Why this score:** Software and data papers describe 
           + artefacts rather than testing hypotheses. They do not 
           + typically include systematic comparisons to alternatives, 
           + sensitivity analyses, or robustness checks in the way 
           + empirical studies do. A Moderate Robustness score reflects 
           + these different genre expectations — it is not a criticism 
           + of the paper.
       149    
       150 -  **What this means:** The paper builds a coherent case for 
           - FAIMS as a solution to field data collection challenges but 
           - does not exhaustively compare alternative approaches.
       150 +  **What this means:** The paper describes FAIMS 
           + architecture, features, and use cases. It does not claim to 
           + have tested FAIMS against alternative approaches or 
           + demonstrated superiority through controlled comparison. This
           +  is appropriate: software papers in venues like SoftwareX 
           + are meant to document software, not conduct comparative 
           + evaluations.
       151    
       152 -  **What readers should consider:** Evaluate alternative 
           - field data collection software (commercial tools, other 
           - academic platforms, ad-hoc solutions) independently when 
           - assessing whether FAIMS is appropriate for their context.
       152 +  **What readers should consider:** When deciding whether to 
           + adopt FAIMS (or any research software), readers should 
           + independently evaluate alternatives appropriate to their 
           + context. The paper provides the information needed to 
           + understand FAIMS; comparative assessment is the reader's 
           + responsibility.
       153    
       154 +  **Generalisation:** Similar Robustness patterns should be 
           + expected for other software papers, data papers, and 
           + infrastructure descriptions. These genres prioritise 
           + Transparency and Reproducibility (can you access and use the
           +  artefact?) over Robustness (was it tested against 
           + alternatives?).

       100    
       101 -  The paper demonstrates moderate robustness, consistent with
           -  its advocacy nature. FAIMS is presented as the solution to 
           - field data collection problems, with limited comparison to 
           - alternatives. This is appropriate for a software paper 
           - promoting a particular approach but limits robustness 
           - assessment.
       101 +  The paper demonstrates moderate robustness, appropriate for
           +  a software description paper. FAIMS is described as a 
           + solution to field data collection problems; the paper 
           + documents what the software does rather than testing it 
           + against alternatives. This is exactly what software papers 
           + in venues like SoftwareX are meant to do.
       102    
       103 -  The paper acknowledges some limitations: development 
           -  challenges (E006-E012) including testing infrastructure 
           -  needs, GUI creation difficulties, and complexity costs. 
           -  This honest acknowledgement strengthens robustness within 
           -  the advocacy framing.

       104    
       105 -  Alternative approaches are mentioned but not systematically

           -  (commercial software, ad-hoc solutions) but does not 
           -  provide detailed comparison. Sensitivity to design choices 
           -  (e.g., Android vs iOS, modular vs monolithic) is discussed 
           -  qualitatively but not tested.

> can we tweak the report template or the prompts to encourage 
contextualisation of 'spacialised' papers like data and software papers? Can
 you think of other common types of papers that might need similar 
contextualisation? I don't think we should change the scores, I think the 
scoring / basic critique is reasonable. 

● Let me first commit these framing updates, then address the
  template/prompt changes:

● Bash(git add outputs/ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018/assessment/
      outputs/phase-1-validation-summary.md && git commit -m "fix(assessment):
      reframe software paper context f…)
  ⎿ [main afaba61] fix(assessment): reframe software paper context from 'ad
    vocacy' to genre expectations
     3 files changed, 39 insertions(+), 37 deletions(-)


● Now let me find the relevant templates/prompts and think about specialized
   paper types:

● Search(pattern: "assessment-system/prompts/**/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 7 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/cluster-2-evidential-strength.md)
  ⎿  Read 627 lines

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/10-final-report-prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 429 lines

● Good insight. Let me identify the paper types that need similar
  contextualization and update both prompts:

  Paper types with different Robustness expectations:

  1. Descriptive/Artefact papers (describe rather than test):
    - Software papers
    - Data papers
    - Infrastructure/platform papers
    - Protocol/methods papers (when descriptive)
    - Resource papers (databases, ontologies)
  2. Synthesis/Framework papers (argue rather than test):
    - Theoretical/conceptual papers
    - Position papers
    - Commentary/response papers
    - Narrative reviews (systematic reviews are different)

       129 +  
       130 +  **When assessing Robustness (Cluster 2) and generating the 
           + final report (Pass 10), these subtypes trigger context flags
           +  that explain genre-appropriate expectations:**
       131 +  
       132 +  #### 📦 Descriptive/Artefact Papers (Robustness context 
           + flag)
       133 +  
       134 +  These describe artefacts rather than test hypotheses. 
           + Moderate Robustness is expected, not a deficiency:
       135 +

           + Moderate-Good (50-70) |
       154 +  
       155 +  **Note:** Systematic reviews are different — they DO 
           + require robustness checks and should NOT receive 📐 flag.
       156 +  
       157 +  #### 🔧 Methodological Transparency (Reproducibility 
           + context flag)
       158 +  
       159 +  For papers without computational workflows to reproduce:
       160 +  
       161 +  | Subtype | Reproducibility Question |
       162 +  |---------|-------------------------|

● Done. Updated prompts with expanded context flag system:

  Context Flags Added:

  | Flag | Category                    | Paper Types
                         |
  |------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------
  -----------------------|
  | 📦   | Descriptive/Artefact        | Software, data, infrastructure,
  protocol, resource papers |
  | 📐   | Synthesis/Framework         | Theoretical, position, commentary,
  narrative review       |
  | 🔧   | Methodological Transparency | Non-computational reproducibility
                         |

  Key changes:

  1. cluster-2-evidential-strength.md: Added special case handling for
  Robustness scoring with explicit guidance that Moderate (40-60) is
  expected for descriptive papers — not a deficiency.
  2. 10-final-report-prompt.md: Expanded context flag interpretation with
  templates explaining what scores mean for each paper type.
  3. classify-research-approach.md: Added paper subtypes mapping so
  classification correctly captures whether a paper is software_tool,
  data_paper, infrastructure, etc.

  The key insight now baked into the prompts:
  Software/data papers describe artefacts rather than test hypotheses. They 
  don't include systematic comparisons or sensitivity analyses because 
  that's not their purpose. Comparative assessment is the reader's 
  responsibility.

  Commits:
  - afaba61 - Fix: Reframe software paper context
  - 90d50d8 - Feat: Add context flags for specialised paper types

> Cool. The best software / infrastructure papers will compare alternatives,
 but that's really exceptional and they will score higher than usual, which 
is correct.\

What is next on our to-do list? Is it time to initiate a run to test 
variability? Something else first? 

● Based on our earlier discussion, the next logical step is Phase 2: 
  Reliability Testing — running the pipeline multiple times on the same
  papers to assess consistency/variability.

  What we've completed:
  - ✅ Phase 1: Template validation across 4 diverse paper types
  - ✅ Context flag refinement (📦 software/data, 📐 synthesis, 🔧
  methodological transparency)

  Phase 2 would involve:
  - Pick 2-3 papers (suggest: one empirical, one methodological)
  - Run assessment pipeline (Passes 8-10) 10x each
  - Track signal scores and verdicts across runs
  - Calculate variance/consistency metrics
  - Identify which signals are most/least stable

  Practical considerations:
  - Each run is ~3-5 minutes of LLM time
  - 10 runs × 2-3 papers = 20-30 runs
  - Could do in parallel batches or sequential
  - Need to decide: same session or fresh sessions?

  Candidates from existing extractions:
  - sobotkova-et-al-2024 (empirical/deductive) — well-extracted, good
  baseline
  - ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 (methodological/software) — tests 📦 flag
  consistency
  - ross-2005 (interpretive) — tests 🔧 variant consistency

  Alternative first steps:
  - Test on 1-2 more papers to expand coverage before variability testing
  - Document expected score ranges by paper type (based on Phase 1 findings)

  Ready to proceed with Phase 2, or prefer something else first?

> I'm actually interested in the consistency / variability of the entire 
pipeline. I know it's a lot of work, but I think we should choose 3-5 papers
 and run the full, beginning-to-end assessment 5 times on each of them. Do 
you think we've run passes 8-10 on enought papers to have basic confidence, 
so that we can move on to this test? 

● Good question. Let me assess our coverage:

  Passes 8-10 testing so far (4 papers):

  | Paper                      | Type           | Approach  | Era  |
  Discipline       | Flags    |
  |----------------------------|----------------|-----------|------|--------
  ----------|----------|
  | sobotkova-et-al-2024       | Empirical      | Deductive | 2024 |
  Archaeology (ML) | Standard |
  | penske-et-al-2023          | Empirical      | Inductive | 2023 |
  Archaeogenetics  | Standard |
  | ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 | Methodological | —         | 2018 |
  Software         | 📦 🔧    |
  | ross-2005                  | Empirical      | Inductive | 2005 |
  Classics         | 🔧       |

  Coverage achieved:
  - ✅ Empirical and methodological paper types
  - ✅ Deductive, inductive, interpretive approaches
  - ✅ Three eras (pre-2015, 2015-2020, 2020+)
  - ✅ Both context flag variants (📦, 🔧)
  - ✅ All produced coherent reports with scores in expected ranges

  Not yet tested:
  - ❌ Theoretical papers
  - ❌ LOW or MODERATE quality states (all 4 were HIGH)
  - ❌ Papers with significant extraction problems

  My assessment: Yes, we have enough basic confidence to proceed. The
  template structure works across the major paper types and approaches. Full
   pipeline testing will:

  1. Stress-test extraction consistency (Passes 0-7) — which we haven't
  systematically tested
  2. Reveal whether extraction variability propagates to assessment
  variability
  3. Give us end-to-end reliability data

  Recommendation: Proceed with 3-5 papers × 5 full runs.

  Want me to draft a plan for the full pipeline variability test? I'd
  suggest selecting papers that already have source text available to
  minimize setup time.

> Yes, I'd like to go ahead and utilise some of the same papers we've been 
testing on so far, in 'inputs' - I would suggest 4-5 papers so that we get a
 good spread of types. Include in your plan where artefacts and reports 
generated by all these runs should be stored and how they should be named so
 that they are easy to find and work with afterwards, when we do cross-run 
assessment.

● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · The 5 proposed papers are: sobotkova-et-al-2024, penske-et-al-2023, 
     ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018, ross-2005, and sobotkova-et-al-2016. Good 
     selection, or would you prefer different papers? → These 5 are good
     · This is substantial work (~25 hours LLM time for 5 papers × 5 runs). 
     How would you like to approach the scope? → Full test (5×5)

     · The proposed storage structure uses 
     outputs/variability-test/{paper}/run-01/ etc. Does this work for your 
     analysis needs? → Structure looks good

● Confirmed: 5 papers, 5 runs each, proposed storage structure. Let me
  finalize the plan with decisions and execution checklist:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/partitioned-mapping-river.md

● Plan finalized with:
  - 5 papers covering empirical (deductive, inductive, interpretive),
  methodological, and mixed-methods types
  - 25 full pipeline runs (5 papers × 5 runs each)
  - Storage: outputs/variability-test/{paper}/run-XX/
  - Analysis outputs for cross-run comparison

  Ready to proceed with execution.

     │ - Each full pipeline run takes ~45-60 minutes                           │
     │ - Total time: 5 papers × 5 runs × ~1 hour = ~25 hours of LLM time       │
