  consolidation (~5-10% reduction) rather than the typical 15-20%:

> could you tell me how many implicit RDMAP items were extracted? 

● 8 implicit RDMAP items were extracted, representing 29.6% of the total RDMAP items.

  Breakdown by tier:

  - Implicit Research Designs: 0
  - Implicit Methods: 4
  - Implicit Protocols: 4

  The 4 implicit methods were:

  1. M-IMP-001: Visual examination methodology for evaluating model predictions
  2. M-IMP-002: Manual visibility assessment method for selecting training data
  3. M-IMP-003: Pre-trained model selection and preliminary experimentation methodology
  4. M-IMP-004: Overfitting detection method

  The 4 implicit protocols were:

  1. P-IMP-001: Mosaicking and edge cropping procedure (consolidated with P008 in Pass 5)
  2. P-IMP-002: GPS recording specifications and accuracy parameters
  3. P-IMP-003: Preservation status assessment using Likert scale
  4. P-IMP-004: Mound diameter boundary determination procedure
  5. P-IMP-005: Implementation details documented in GitHub repository

  The 29.6% implicit ratio falls within the expected 20-40% range for empirical papers, indicating the paper
  has good explicit methodology documentation but leaves some operational and assessment procedures
  undocumented or mentioned without full procedural details.
