  Just Completed (This Session)

  Pass 6 Infrastructure Extraction - Added reproducibility infrastructure metadata (13-section FAIR assessment) to final
  2 papers:
  - connor-et-al-2013: Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (7 authors, 7 funding sources, 13 radiocarbon dates, FAIR
  10/16, PID 1/6)
  - ross-et-al-2009: Remote sensing methodology (3 authors, QuickBird satellite imagery, methodologically excellent with
  honest failure reporting, FAIR 8/16, PID 1/6)

  Also merged sobotkova-et-al-2016 infrastructure from previous session.

  Project State

  ✅ All 10 papers now complete with Pass 0-6 extractions + infrastructure metadata:
  - ross-2005 (philology)
  - ross-et-al-2009 (remote sensing)
  - connor-et-al-2013 (palaeoecology)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2016 (FAIMS co-development)
  - eftimoski-et-al-2017 (landscape archaeology)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2021 (mobile GIS)
  - ross-ballsun-stanton-2022 (preregistration methodology)
  - penske-et-al-2023 (archaeogenetics)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2023 (crowdsourcing)
  - sobotkova-et-al-2024 (CNN validation)

  Each has: extraction.json (evidence, claims, implicit_arguments, research_designs, methods, protocols) +
  reproducibility_infrastructure (FAIR assessment, PIDs, funding, data/code availability)

  Next Task: Section 5 Phase 1 - Empirical Analysis

  From: planning/active-todo-list.md Section 5

  Goal: Analyze 10 completed extractions to assess quality, identify patterns, inform metrics guidance decisions

  Tasks (4-6 hours estimated):
  1. Extract count distributions across all papers
  2. Apply quality rubric to identify goldilocks/under-extracted/over-extracted papers
  3. Check granularity consistency
  4. Detect target-seeking behaviour (do numeric targets help or harm?)
  5. Decide: keep/modify/remove numeric guidance in prompts

  Deliverable: Empirical analysis report informing whether to proceed with multi-run variation study or expand to new
  papers

  User Request

  User asked what analysis steps come next after infrastructure extraction. I identified Phase 1 empirical analysis from
  active-todo-list.md. User then noted low context and requested this /compact message.

  We are in PLAN MODE - no execution yet, just planning next steps.

> Hi CC, welcome back. How to you propose that we undertake analysis pipeline construction? I imagine that we'll need a 
series of prompts, plus orchestration, and probably new documentation added to the skill. Do you want to jump straight to
 prompt composition, do a manual review of a couple of papers first so you know what to look for, or something else? To 
consider what should go into prompts and what into the skill, invoke the skill-creator skill and follow best practice. 

● I think the right approach is strategic - let me invoke skill-creator first to understand best practices for what
  should be a skill vs orchestration/prompts, then propose a concrete plan.
  ⎿  Error: Unknown skill: skill-creator

● The skill-creator skill isn't available, but let me think through best practices and propose an approach:

  Recommended Approach: Strategic Manual Review → Design → Implement

  Phase 1: Manual Review & Pattern Recognition (30-60 min)

  Why: Before writing prompts, we need to understand what "good" vs "problematic" extractions actually look like in
  practice.

  Action:
  1. Read planning/extraction-assessment-rubric-v1.md thoroughly
  2. Manually review 2-3 papers against rubric:
    - One "goldilocks" paper (likely ross-ballsun-stanton-2022 based on cross-paper-error-analysis.md grades)
    - One potentially under-extracted paper
    - One potentially over-extracted paper (if any exist)
  3. Document concrete patterns:
    - What does appropriate granularity look like?
    - What signals target-seeking behaviour?
    - What distinguishes complete vs incomplete extraction?

  Phase 2: Design Decision - Skill vs Orchestration

  Skill appropriate if:
  - Analysis will be reused for future paper batches ✓
  - Requires domain expertise about extraction quality ✓
  - Needs consistent rubric application ✓

  Prompts + scripts appropriate if:
  - One-off analysis tied to specific 10 papers
  - Simple metric extraction (counts, distributions)
  - Linear workflow without complex decisions

  My recommendation: Hybrid approach
  - Skill: Quality assessment logic (applying rubric, identifying patterns, making judgments about
  goldilocks/under/over-extraction)
  - Orchestration script: Metric extraction, count distributions, report generation
  - Prompts: Guide the skill invocations with specific questions

  Phase 3: Implementation

  Based on manual review findings:
  1. Document quality assessment criteria in skill knowledge
  2. Create analysis orchestration script
  3. Write prompts for each analysis task
  4. Run pipeline on all 10 papers

  Proposed Plan

  Would you like me to:

  1. Start with manual review - examine 2-3 papers against rubric, document patterns, then design pipeline based on
  findings?
  2. Or if you already have clear intuitions about what to look for, we could skip straight to designing the analysis
  structure?

  Which approach feels right given your familiarity with the extractions?

> please double-check that the skill-creator skill isn't available - we used it previously. if it isn't, then we first 
need to fix that problem. 

● You're absolutely right - let me check with the fully qualified name:
  ⎿  Error: Unknown skill: example-skills:skill-creator

● You're right - the skill-creator skill is referenced in my approved tools list but isn't available. Let me investigate
  what's happening:

● Search(pattern: "**/*skill*.md")
  ⎿  Found 15 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/.claude/skills/**")
  ⎿  Found 11 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ 2>&1 || echo "Skills directory not found")
  ⎿  ls: cannot access '/home/shawn/.claude/skills/': No such file or directory
     Skills directory not found

● I found the project has .claude/skills/research-assessor/ but skill-creator isn't there. Let me check the archived
  planning docs that reference skill guidance:

● Read(archive/planning-completed/prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md)
  ⎿  Read 449 lines

● Perfect - this confirms skill-creator was used in October, but it's not available now. This is indeed a problem we need
   to fix. Let me check if there's configuration or if it's a managed skill that needs to be enabled:

● Bash(cat ~/.claude/config.json 2>&1 || echo "Config not found")
  ⎿  cat: /home/shawn/.claude/config.json: No such file or directory
     Config not found
  ⎿  Error: Slash command help is not a prompt-based command

● I've confirmed the problem. Here's what I found:

  Problem Summary

  skill-creator is missing:

  1. ✅ Was available in October 2025 - Your archived document prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md from 2025-10-27 shows
   it was used successfully
  2. ✅ Is in my approved tools list - Shows as Skill(example-skills:skill-creator) in my system configuration
  3. ❌ Not in my available_skills list - Only research-assessor appears
  4. ❌ Fails when invoked - Both skill-creator and example-skills:skill-creator return "Unknown skill"

  What I Checked

  - No ~/.claude/skills/ directory (returns "No such file or directory")
  - No ~/.claude/config.json file
  - Project has .claude/skills/research-assessor/ (which works fine)
  - No other skill directories found

  Likely Causes

  This could be:
  1. Managed skill availability - skill-creator might be a managed skill that's temporarily unavailable or was removed
  2. Version change - Claude Code might have changed how managed skills work between October and now
  3. Configuration issue - Something needs to be enabled or installed
  4. Permissions - skill-creator might need explicit enablement

  Question for You

  How would you like to proceed?

  1. Skip skill-creator for now - Use the guidance from the archived document (which captured all the key principles) and
   design the analysis pipeline based on those principles directly
  2. Debug availability - You might need to check Claude Code settings, update, or reinstall something
  3. Alternative approach - If skill-creator is no longer available, we can work with the principles documented in the
  archived file

  Which path makes sense?

> We're goint to try to fix it, I'm dropping out of plan mode, and have some suggestions from Sonnet 4.5 in the chatbot. 
Please pause 

● Understood - pausing here while you work on fixing skill-creator availability. I'll wait for you to return with updates
   or new instructions.

  Take your time!
