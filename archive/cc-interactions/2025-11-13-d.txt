  ---
  Phase 4 Complete: FAIR4RS Compliance Assessment ✅

  File created: docs/FAIR4RS_COMPLIANCE.md (41KB, 1240 lines)

  Key findings:
  - Current score: 7/15 (47%, Minimally FAIR) - improved from initial 6/15 after discovering dual licensing
  - Reusability: 4/4 (FULL COMPLIANCE) ✅ - Exemplary dual licensing already in place
  - Critical discovery: LICENSE-CODE (Apache-2.0) + LICENSE-DOCS (CC-BY-4.0) = best practice for research software
  - Recommendation: Do NOT combine licences - dual licensing is conventional and correct

  Dimension scores:
  - Findability (F1-F4): 0/4 (no persistent identifier yet)
  - Accessibility (A1-A2): 2/4 (open protocols, but no metadata persistence)
  - Interoperability (I1-I3): 1/3 (formal formats, missing FAIR vocabularies)
  - Reusability (R1-R4): 4/4 (docs + dual licensing exemplary)

  Remediation plan:
  - Priority 1 (4-6 hours → 14/15): DOI, CodeMeta.json, CITATION.cff, registration
  - Priority 2 (20-40 hours → 15/15): FAIR controlled vocabularies (v2.7 planned)

  ---
  Metadata Infrastructure Created ✅

  Three files created/updated:

  1. codemeta.json (NEW, 4.6KB)
    - CodeMeta 2.0 standard machine-readable metadata
    - Dual licensing, placeholder DOI, dependencies, references to FAIR4RS papers
    - Enables: GitHub citation button, Zenodo auto-population, Google Dataset Search
  2. CITATION.cff (UPDATED, 2.9KB)
    - Updated from v2.5 placeholder to v2.6 with Shawn Graham authorship
    - Placeholder DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.PLACEHOLDER (update at v3.0/v0.5 release)
    - Full author lists for FAIR4RS + FAIR principles papers in references
    - Enables: GitHub "Cite this repository" button (works immediately)
  3. README.md (UPDATED)
    - Added licence badges at top (Apache-2.0, CC-BY-4.0)
    - Added Licence section documenting dual licensing structure
    - Links to LICENSE-CODE and LICENSE-DOCS

  FAIR score impact: 7/15 → 9/15 (added F2 rich metadata + I3 qualified references)

  When DOI minted (v3.0/v0.5): Update 2 lines (codemeta.json:10, CITATION.cff:12) → 14/15 FAIR

  Next Session Topics

  User wants to discuss:
  1. FAIR vocabularies (I2 compliance) - Controlled vocabularies for research designs, methods, protocols
  2. Continue documentation work - Phases 5-7 remaining (examples/, additional READMEs, cleanup)

  Context for vocabularies discussion:
  - Gap analysis in FAIR4RS_COMPLIANCE.md (lines 1055-1101, Gap 2.1)
  - Planning: pass6-phase1-testing-findings.md documents empirical vocabulary needs
  - Requires 20+ paper corpus for evidence-based vocabulary development
  - JSON-LD integration needed (schema update)

  Remaining documentation phases:
  - Phase 5: Examples directory with sample extractions
  - Phase 6: Additional READMEs (planning/, reports/, scripts/)
  - Phase 7: Global cleanup and final verification

  ---
  Resume: "Ready to discuss FAIR vocabularies development (I2 compliance) or continue with documentation Phases 5-7. We have complete FAIR4RS assessment and metadata
  infrastructure in place (codemeta.json, CITATION.cff). Current FAIR score: 9/15, target with DOI: 14/15, target with vocabularies: 15/15."

> What FAIR vocabularies development do you see as necessary for I2 compliance? 

● I'll analyze the I2 compliance gap and propose a practical vocabularies development approach based on the extraction work we've done.

● Based on my analysis of the current FAIR4RS compliance assessment and the Pass 6 testing findings, here's my perspective on the vocabularies development needed for
  I2 compliance:

  I2 Gap Analysis: What We Need

  Current status: I2 (Software uses FAIR-compliant vocabularies where they exist) = 0/1 points

  The problem isn't that we're using the wrong vocabularies—it's that we're using ad hoc, uncontrolled terminology with no persistent identifiers for three critical
  object types:

  1. Research Designs (e.g., "survey methodology", "excavation strategy", "experimental design")
  2. Methods (e.g., "geophysical prospection", "ceramic analysis", "radiocarbon dating")
  3. Protocols (e.g., "Harris Matrix recording", "photogrammetry workflow", "soil sampling procedure")

  Why This Matters for Interoperability

  Without controlled vocabularies:
  - Cannot aggregate extractions across papers ("show me all papers using radiocarbon dating")
  - Cannot map to existing ontologies (Darwin Core, Getty AAT, CIDOC-CRM)
  - Cannot enable semantic search ("find papers with experimental designs testing lithic technology")
  - Cannot integrate with archaeological data repositories

  Example of the problem:
  Current extraction might record:
  "method_name": "ceramic typological analysis"

  But another paper might use:
  - "pottery classification"
  - "ceramic seriation"
  - "typological study of ceramics"

  All refer to similar concepts but no machine can recognise equivalence.

  My Recommended Approach: Evidence-Based Vocabularies

  I strongly advocate for empirical development rather than top-down ontology creation:

  Phase 1: Corpus Extraction (v2.7, 20-40 hours)

  1. Extract 20+ papers across fieldwork disciplines:
    - Archaeology (10 papers: excavation, survey, experimental)
    - Ecology (5 papers: field surveys, transects, camera traps)
    - Ethnography (3 papers: participant observation, interviews)
    - Field geology (2 papers: stratigraphy, sampling)
  2. Aggregate terminology from extractions:
    - Count frequency of research design types
    - Catalogue method names with usage contexts
    - Document protocol patterns
  3. Identify clusters:
    - "excavation", "archaeological excavation", "stratigraphic excavation" → same concept
    - "radiocarbon dating", "C14 dating", "AMS radiocarbon" → same method, different protocols

  Phase 2: Vocabulary Publication (v2.7, 10-20 hours)

  Create three separate SKOS vocabularies with Zenodo DOIs:

  1. Fieldwork Research Designs Vocabulary
  @prefix rdmap: <https://w3id.org/rdmap/designs/> .
  @prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

  rdmap:survey-methodology a skos:Concept ;
      skos:prefLabel "Survey Methodology"@en ;
      skos:altLabel "Archaeological Survey"@en ;
      skos:altLabel "Field Survey Design"@en ;
      skos:definition "Strategic framework for systematic investigation of landscape or region"@en ;
      skos:broader rdmap:spatial-sampling ;
      skos:related rdmap:transect-design .

  2. Fieldwork Methods Vocabulary
  rdmap:radiocarbon-dating a skos:Concept ;
      skos:prefLabel "Radiocarbon Dating"@en ;
      skos:altLabel "C14 Dating"@en ;
      skos:definition "Chronometric method using radioactive decay of carbon-14"@en ;
      skos:broader rdmap:chronometric-methods ;
      skos:exactMatch <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001359> .

  3. Fieldwork Protocols Vocabulary
  rdmap:harris-matrix-recording a skos:Concept ;
      skos:prefLabel "Harris Matrix Recording"@en ;
      skos:definition "Stratigraphic recording protocol using matrix diagram"@en ;
      skos:broader rdmap:stratigraphic-recording ;
      skos:related rdmap:single-context-recording .

  Phase 3: Schema Integration (v2.7, 4-8 hours)

  Update extraction schema to JSON-LD:

  {
    "@context": {
      "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/rdmap/schema/",
      "skos": "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#",
      "rdmap": "https://w3id.org/rdmap/designs/"
    },
    "research_designs": [
      {
        "design_id": "RD001",
        "design_name": "Survey Methodology",
        "@type": "rdmap:survey-methodology",
        "skos:broader": "rdmap:spatial-sampling",
        "tier": "strategic"
      }
    ]
  }

  Pragmatic Scope Decisions

  What to include:
  - ✅ Common fieldwork research designs (empirically observed in 20+ papers)
  - ✅ Methods mentioned ≥3 times across corpus
  - ✅ Protocols with distinct procedural differences

  What to exclude:
  - ❌ Ultra-specific techniques mentioned once ("Sobotkova's tablet workflow")
  - ❌ Proprietary software names as methods (tools ≠ methods)
  - ❌ Theoretical frameworks (not operational methods)

  Alignment with Existing Vocabularies

  Where possible, create skos:exactMatch or skos:closeMatch to:

  1. Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT):
    - http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300053682 (archaeological excavation)
    - http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300054698 (survey methods)
  2. CIDOC-CRM (cultural heritage):
    - http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E7_Activity (fieldwork activities)
  3. Darwin Core (ecology):
    - http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/samplingProtocol
  4. Environment Ontology (ENVO):
    - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001359 (radiocarbon dating)

  FAIR Score Impact

  Before vocabularies (current):
  - I2: 0/1 (no FAIR vocabularies)
  - Total: 9/15 (Moderately FAIR)

  After vocabularies (v2.7):
  - I2: 1/1 ✅ (FAIR SKOS vocabularies with Zenodo DOIs)
  - Total: 10/15 (still Moderately FAIR, but meaningful improvement)

  Combined with DOI minting:
  - F1, F3, F4, A1, A2: +5 points
  - I2: +1 point
  - Total: 15/15 (Exemplary FAIR) 🎯

  Effort Estimate

  | Phase                   | Tasks                           | Hours       | Deliverable                    |
  |-------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
  | Corpus extraction       | Extract 20+ papers (Passes 0-6) | 20-30       | 20 extraction.json files       |
  | Terminology aggregation | Count, cluster, analyse         | 8-12        | Frequency tables, concept maps |
  | Vocabulary creation     | SKOS files, Zenodo deposit      | 6-10        | 3 vocabularies with DOIs       |
  | Schema integration      | JSON-LD context, validation     | 4-6         | Schema v2.7                    |
  | Total                   |                                 | 38-58 hours | I2 compliance achieved         |

  Critical Success Factors

  1. Evidence-based: Don't invent terms—extract from real papers
  2. Domain-focused: Start with archaeology/HASS, expand later
  3. Hierarchical: Use SKOS broader/narrower for generalisability
  4. Aligned: Map to existing ontologies where possible
  5. Persistent: Zenodo DOIs for vocabularies (FAIR vocabularies must be FAIR themselves!)

  My Recommendation

  Start Phase 1 (corpus extraction) immediately in v2.7. You already have:
  - ✅ Extraction system validated (Passes 0-6 working)
  - ✅ 4 papers extracted (proof of concept)
  - ✅ Infrastructure in place (schema, prompts, validation)

  The vocabulary work is empirically driven—we need those 20+ extractions to see patterns. This isn't premature; it's the natural next step.

  Question for you: Do you want to proceed with corpus extraction for vocabulary development, or focus on completing documentation Phases 5-7 first? Both are valuable,
   but vocabularies unlock the final FAIR point (I2) and transform the tool from single-paper extraction to cross-corpus analysis.

> Ok, now I understand! I defintely want to undertake this vocab development, but not now - can you write this out to a planning document and reference it in our 
active to-do list? We'll return to it later, I'd like to complete documentation first. 

● I'll create a comprehensive planning document for vocabulary development and reference it in the active to-do list.

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive planning document and updated the active to-do list. Here's what I've done:

  Created Planning Document

  File: planning/fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md (31KB, comprehensive)

  Key sections:
  - Problem statement (ad hoc terminology, no URIs, no interoperability)
  - Evidence-based development approach (bottom-up from 20-paper corpus)
  - Three-phase plan with detailed timelines
  - SKOS vocabulary structure examples
  - External ontology alignment strategy (Getty AAT, Darwin Core, ENVO, CIDOC-CRM)
  - Scope decisions and exclusion criteria
  - FAIR principles for vocabularies (meta-requirement: vocabularies must themselves be FAIR)
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Post-v1.0 roadmap (v1.1, v2.0 enhancements)

  Updated Active To-Do List

  Added Section 6: FAIR Vocabularies Development
  - Moved to "Deferred / Future Projects" (post-documentation)
  - Cross-referenced planning document
  - Summary of three-phase approach
  - FAIR impact clearly stated (9/15 → 10/15 alone, 9/15 → 15/15 with DOI)
  - Timeline: 38-58 hours, 5-7 weeks, Q1 2025 target
  - When: After documentation Phases 3-7 complete

  Fixed numbering: Renumbered subsequent sections 7, 8, 9

  The planning document is ready for you to return to when documentation is complete. It provides a complete roadmap from corpus selection through vocabulary
  publication to schema integration, with all key decisions documented and effort estimates provided.

  Section 1: Repository Documentation (1-2 hours remaining)

  1.1 Main README Improvements ✅ COMPLETE (updated Nov 13)

  1.2 Subdirectory READMEs (30 min - 1 hour)
  - extraction-system/README.md ✅ Complete
  - outputs/README.md ✅ Complete
  - archive/README.md ✅ Complete
  - ⏳ planning/README.md - Create or verify
  - ⏳ reports/README.md - Create (if reports/ exists)
  - ⏳ examples/README.md - Create (if examples/ exists)

  1.3 Documentation Index (30-45 min)
  - ⏳ Create docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md - Map of all documentation

  Section 2: Code Quality - Script Documentation (3-4 hours)

  NOTE: The to-do list mentions scripts in outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/*.py but these are likely test/development scripts, not production code. Need to clarify:
  - Are these scripts meant to be documented?
  - Or should we focus on extraction-system/scripts/ instead?

  Section 3: FAIR4RS Implementation (1-2 hours)

  3.1 FAIR4RS Assessment ✅ COMPLETE

  3.2 Remaining FAIR4RS Files (1-2 hours):
  - ⏳ CONTRIBUTING.md (doesn't exist at root, but exists at docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - ⏳ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (community standards)
  - LICENSE files ✅ Complete (LICENSE-CODE, LICENSE-DOCS)
  - CITATION.cff ✅ Complete
  - codemeta.json ✅ Complete

  Estimated Remaining Effort

  High Priority Documentation:
  - Subdirectory READMEs: 30 min - 1 hour
  - Documentation index: 30-45 min
  - CONTRIBUTING.md + CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: 1-2 hours
  - Total: 2-4 hours

  Code Quality (if needed):
  - Script documentation: 3-4 hours (needs clarification on which scripts)

  Grand Total: 5-8 hours (2-4 hours without script documentation)

  ---
  My Recommendation

  Complete the high-priority documentation now (2-4 hours):

  1. Check/create remaining subdirectory READMEs (30 min)
  2. Create docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (30-45 min)
  3. Create CONTRIBUTING.md at root (can adapt from docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md) (30-45 min)
  4. Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (use standard Contributor Covenant template) (15-30 min)

  This would complete all repository documentation and bring you to 9/15 FAIR (with metadata files already created).

  Defer script documentation until you clarify which scripts need documentation - the ones in outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/ appear to be test/development scripts
  rather than production utilities.

  Would you like me to proceed with these remaining documentation tasks?

> yes, please complete high priority documentation and then report back to me on remaining tasks so I can decide what to do next and what to defer 

● I'll complete the high-priority documentation tasks. Let me start by checking what exists and then systematically work through the remaining items.

● Bash(ls -la planning/README.md reports/README.md examples/README.md 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 2
     ls: cannot access 'examples/README.md': No such file or directory
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 shawn shawn 4594 Oct 23 17:45 planning/README.md
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 shawn shawn 6423 Oct 23 17:49 reports/README.md

● Bash(ls -d planning/ reports/ examples/ 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 2
     ls: cannot access 'examples/': No such file or directory
     planning/
     reports/

● Good! Most subdirectory READMEs already exist. Let me check if examples/ directory should exist according to the main README:

● Bash(grep -n "examples" README.md | head -10)
  ⎿  70:├── examples/              # Curated extraction examples                   
     99:- **[examples/](examples/)** - Example extractions
     310:- **Documentation** (guides, prompts, examples): [CC-BY-4.0](LICENSE-DOCS)

● The README mentions an examples/ directory but it doesn't exist yet. Let me create a todo list and work through the tasks:

● Now let me start working through these tasks:

● Bash(mkdir -p examples)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(examples/README.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 314 lines to examples/README.md                                                                                                                           
     # Extraction Examples

  ⎿  Read 200 lines

● Perfect! I'll create a repository-level CONTRIBUTING.md that adapts this content:

● Write(CONTRIBUTING.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 521 lines to CONTRIBUTING.md

  📋 Remaining Tasks for Your Decision

  Option 1: Code Quality - Script Documentation (3-4 hours)

  Location: outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/*.py

  Question: Are these production scripts or test/development scripts?

  If production:
  - Document 10 scripts with comprehensive docstrings
  - Add header blocks, function documentation, usage examples
  - Effort: 3-4 hours (30 min per script)

  If test/development:
  - May be better to defer or skip
  - Focus on extraction-system/scripts/ instead (if exists)

  Recommendation: Let me check what scripts exist and you can decide if they need documentation.

  ---
  Option 2: Optional Workflow Improvements (Deferred, Low Priority)

  These are optional enhancements to prompts (Section 4 in active-todo-list.md):

  1. Reframe implicit RDMAP (30 min)
  2. Liberal extraction mental model (30 min)
  3. Relationship mapping emphasis (45 min)

  Status: All marked OPTIONAL - RUN-08 already succeeded with current prompts

  Recommendation: Defer these unless you're updating prompts for another reason.

  ---
  Option 3: Planning and Analysis Work (Medium Priority, Deferred)

  1. Remove Sobotkova-specific metrics (6-9 hours)
    - Needs 10-paper corpus extraction first
    - Empirical analysis before implementing
  2. Infrastructure assessment Phase 2 enhancements (TBD hours)
    - Deferred pending Phase 1 testing evidence
    - Software documentation structure (MEDIUM)
    - Computational environment specification (HIGH)

  Recommendation: Both correctly deferred until more extraction evidence gathered.

  ---
  🎯 My Recommendations

  Immediate (Now):

  1. Check script documentation needs:
    - Let me examine outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/*.py
    - Determine if these are production or test scripts
    - You decide if documentation needed
  2. Consider next major milestone:
    - Option A: Start FAIR vocabularies development (38-58 hours, comprehensive)
    - Option B: Extract 5-10 more papers first (build corpus for vocabularies)
    - Option C: Focus on DOI minting and release (v3.0/v0.5, achieve 14/15 FAIR)

  Short-term (This Week):

  - Commit documentation changes to git
  - Consider creating GitHub release for v2.6 documentation milestone
  - Decide on next major phase (vocabularies vs more extractions vs release)

  Long-term (Next Month):

  - Extract 20-25 paper corpus (for vocabularies)
  - Mint Zenodo DOI (unlock 5 FAIR points → 14/15)
  - Publish FAIR vocabularies (final point → 15/15 Exemplary FAIR)

  ---
  What would you like me to do next?

  Option A: Check script documentation needs and report back

  Option B: Help plan DOI minting and v3.0/v0.5 release

  Option C: Help prioritise next extraction papers for corpus building

  Option D: Something else?

> one quick question, do we need two contributor.md files? Now that you have one in root, do we need the other? 

● Great question! Let me check the difference between them:

     ## Ways to Contribute
     ### 1. Domain Adaptations

● They're essentially the same content! You're right - this is redundant. Here's my recommendation:

  Recommendation: Keep Root, Remove Skill

  Keep: CONTRIBUTING.md (root)
  - This is the standard location GitHub looks for contribution guidelines
  - Shows "Contributing" button on GitHub repository
  - More discoverable for general contributors

  Remove: docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Redundant with root file
  - Adds maintenance burden (need to update both)
  - Not necessary since skill is part of this repository

  Alternative approach: If you want skill-specific contribution guidance, we could:
  - Keep root CONTRIBUTING.md as is
  - Replace docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md with a brief redirect file pointing to root:

  # Contributing to Research Assessor Skill

  See the main repository [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

  The root CONTRIBUTING.md covers all contribution types including:
  - Domain adaptations
  - Extraction examples
  - FAIR vocabulary development
  - Prompt refinement
  - Infrastructure enhancement
  - Testing and validation

  This keeps the file structure logical but avoids duplication.

  What would you prefer?

  Option 1: Delete docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md entirely

  Option 2: Replace it with brief redirect (100 lines → 15 lines)

  Option 3: Keep both (accept maintenance burden)

  I recommend Option 2 - maintains logical documentation structure but eliminates duplication.

> Option 1 is fine, if we ever separate the skill to a separate repo or something like that we'll create a custom contributing.md doc then. 

● Perfect! Let me delete the redundant file:

● Bash(rm docs/research-assessor-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(ls -la docs/research-assessor-guide/)
  ⎿  total 140                                     
     drwxrwxr-x 2 shawn shawn  4096 Nov 13 22:09 .
     drwxrwxr-x 6 shawn shawn  4096 Nov 13 22:01 ..
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Done! The redundant file is removed. Now you have a clean documentation structure with one canonical CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository root.

  📋 Remaining Work (For Your Decision)

  1. Code Quality - Script Documentation (Optional, 3-4 hours)

  Location: outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/*.py
  Decision Needed: Are these production scripts requiring documentation?

  2. Workflow Improvements (Optional, Low Priority)

  Status: Deferred - current prompts working well
  Effort: 1.75 hours if desired

  3. Next Major Milestone (Choose One)

  Option A: FAIR Vocabularies (v2.7)
  - Effort: 38-58 hours
  - Extract 20-25 paper corpus → build vocabularies → achieve 10/15 FAIR
  - See: planning/fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md

  Option B: DOI Release (v3.0/v0.5)
  - Effort: 2-4 hours
  - Mint Zenodo DOI → achieve 14/15 FAIR
  - Requires deciding on internal (v3.0) vs external (v0.5) versioning

  Option C: Corpus Expansion
  - Effort: 15-20 hours
  - Extract 5-10 more diverse papers
  - Build evidence base for vocabularies and metrics analysis

  ---
  What would you like to tackle next?

  A. Check script documentation needs

  B. Plan DOI minting and release

  C. Plan corpus expansion strategy

  D. Defer everything and wrap up this session

> first, we need to export and compact - can you compose a /compact message so that we can resume smoothly in the next sesson? 

● I'll create a comprehensive /compact message for smooth session resumption:

● Bash(echo "Documentation Update v2.6 - High-Priority Documentation Complete…)
  ⎿  Documentation Update v2.6 - High-Priority Documentation Complete

     Session Date: 2025-11-13
     … +190 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! The /compact message is ready. You can copy this comprehensive summary to resume smoothly in your next session.

  Summary

  ✅ All high-priority documentation is now complete!

  You've achieved:
  - 🎯 Professional, shareable repository ready for contributions
  - 📈 FAIR score improved from 7/15 to 9/15 (Moderately FAIR)
