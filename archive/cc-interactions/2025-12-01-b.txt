  Workflow

  1. Get CSV records for team (grep attribution.csv)
  2. Read DPF summary PDF (use Tier 3 ~300KB files, avoid Tier 4 3-11MB SU forms)
  3. Compare unit ranges, walkers, leaders against DPF
  4. Generate runsheet with discrepancies documented (not applied to CSV)
  5. Update queue and commit

  Critical Context

  - DPF scans are authoritative for unit numbers
  - Document corrections only - don't apply to CSV yet
  - User will review all runsheets at the end before corrections are applied
