> /compact   feat(assessment): implement Pass 8 classification prompt with paper
 type taxonomy (Step 2/7 complete)

  Step 2 Implementation: Research Approach Classification Prompt

  COMPLETED:
  - Task 1: Extended approach-taxonomy.md with 4 paper types (v2.1)
    - Empirical, Methodological, Theoretical, Meta-research
    - Validation approach classification for methodological papers
    - Taxonomy evolution/feedback framework for iterative refinement
  - Task 2: Updated classification-schema.md (v2.1)
    - Added paper_type, methodological_characterisation, taxonomy_feedback
    - Extended validation checklist to 11 items
  - Task 3: Created classify-research-approach.md (1,427 lines)
    - 11-step workflow with paper type-specific branching
    - 5 complete examples including poor-fit taxonomy proposal
    - Context-sensitive "none_stated" handling
    - HARKing detection (expressed vs revealed comparison)
    - Fail-fast error handling
    - classifier_version = "v0.2-alpha"

  FILES MODIFIED:
  - .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/credibility/approach-taxonomy.md
 (+298 lines → 509 total)
  - .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/schema/classification-schema.md 
(+125 lines → 555 total)

  FILES CREATED:
  - assessment-system/prompts/classify-research-approach.md (1,427 lines)

  KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
  - Option C: Nested classification (paper type → approach/validation)
  - Taxonomy feedback mechanism: category_fit_quality + proposals
  - User requested feedback feature for iterative taxonomy refinement
  - Methodological papers use validation approach (not research approach)

  READY FOR NEXT SESSION:
  - Step 3: Test classifier on 3 papers (3 runs each = 9 total)
    - sobotkova-et-al-2024 (expected: empirical/inductive)
    - ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 (expected: methodological/software_tool)
      ⚠️  NOTE: Only has infrastructure-pass6-extraction.json - may need full 
extraction first
    - penske-et-al-2023 (expected: empirical/deductive)
  - Test-retest reliability measurement (SD < 10 threshold)
  - Metric-signal correlation check

  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
  - Following: planning/credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md
  - Phase 1 detailed roadmap: Part 7, Steps 1-3
  - Next: Step 3 (1.5 hours) - Classification testing with reliability checks

  VALIDATION:
  - All cross-references verified (5/5 skill files exist)
  - UK spelling consistent
  - 21-item self-validation checklist
  - All workflow steps (11/11) present
  - Formatting matches existing prompts

  Total additions: 1,850 lines across 3 files
  Estimated completion: ~1.5 hours (as planned)

● Excellent catch! I found and fixed 11 ALL CAPS filename violations:

  Fixed Files

  archive/planning-completed/ (4 files):
  - CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md → cleanup-summary.md
  - CONTEXT-FOR-EXTERNAL-REVIEW.md → context-for-external-review.md (just
  moved in this session!)
  - QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md → qa-remediation-plan.md
  - SESSION-SUMMARY-credibility-assessment-planning.md →
  session-summary-credibility-assessment-planning.md (just moved in this
  session!)

  archive/extraction-development/ (5 files):
  - PROMPT_REVISION_SUMMARY.md → prompt-revision-summary.md
  - VERIFICATION_PROCEDURES_RDMAP_UPDATE.md →
  verification-procedures-rdmap-update.md
  - COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md → completion-summary.md
  - FINAL_SUMMARY.md → final-summary.md
  - PACKAGING_COMPLETE.md → packaging-complete.md

  archive/superseded-prompts/ (1 file):
  - QA_QI_PROMPT.md → qa-qi-prompt.md

  outputs/ (1 file):
  - eftimoski-et-al-2017/assessment/SUMMARY.txt → summary.txt

  Verification

  ✅ No remaining ALL CAPS violations in active codebase
  ✅ Excluded from enforcement: outputs.backup-pre-migration/ (preserved
  as-is)
  ✅ Proper exceptions maintained: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, LICENSE, CITATION.cff

  Commits Created

  - 1f0d18b - Fixed 10 markdown files
  - c358ed8 - Fixed 1 txt file

  Both commits pushed to origin/main.

  You were right - I had slipped back into ALL CAPS for those files I just
  moved to archive! All fixed now following the lowercase-with-hyphens
  convention from CLAUDE.md.

> thanks for the fix - any suggestions as to how we can make sure you follow
 this style guide? You've been slipping back into all-caps. 

● You're right - I need better guardrails. Here are some suggestions:

  1. Pre-Commit Hook (Most Effective)

  Add a git pre-commit hook to reject ALL CAPS violations automatically:

  #!/bin/bash
  # .git/hooks/pre-commit

  # Find ALL CAPS files (excluding exceptions)
  violations=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACR | \
    grep -E '\.(md|py|json|yaml|yml|txt)$' | \
    grep -E '/[A-Z][A-Z_-]+\.(md|py|json|yaml|yml|txt)$' | \
    grep -v -E '/(README|CHANGELOG|CONTRIBUTING|CODE_OF_CONDUCT|CLAUDE|SKILL
  |CITATION|LICENSE)\.(md|txt)$')

  if [ -n "$violations" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: ALL CAPS filenames detected (violates CLAUDE.md):"
    echo "$violations" | sed 's/^/  /'
    echo ""
    echo "Use lowercase-with-hyphens: my-file.md (not MY_FILE.md)"
    echo "Exceptions: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CLAUDE, SKILL, 
  LICENSE, CITATION"
    exit 1
  fi

  This would have caught me before the commits went through.

  2. Validation Script I Can Run

  Create a script I can run before committing:

  #!/bin/bash
  # scripts/check-filename-style.sh

  echo "Checking filename style compliance..."
  violations=$(find . -type f \
    \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o
  -name "*.txt" \) \
    -not -path "./outputs.backup-pre-migration/*" \
    -not -path "./archive/output/*" \
    -not -path "./.git/*" \
    -not -path "./.venv/*" \
    -not -path "./venv/*" | \
    grep -E "/[A-Z][A-Z_-]+\.(md|py|json|yaml|yml|txt)$" | \
    grep -v -E "(README|CHANGELOG|CONTRIBUTING|CODE_OF_CONDUCT|CLAUDE|SKILL|
  CITATION|LICENSE)")

  if [ -n "$violations" ]; then
    echo "❌ Found ALL CAPS violations:"
    echo "$violations"
    exit 1
  else
    echo "✅ All filenames comply with style guide"
  fi

  3. My Workflow Change (Immediate)

  I should add a mandatory self-check step before every commit where I:

  # Before git commit, run:
  git status --short | grep -E "^[AR]" | grep -E
  "[A-Z][A-Z_-]+\.(md|txt|py|json|yaml)$"

  If this returns anything (except exceptions), I fix it before committing.

  4. Enhanced CLAUDE.md Reminder

  Add a more prominent section to CLAUDE.md that I see during file
  operations:

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Filename Convention Enforcement

  **BEFORE creating ANY new file, verify:**
  - ✅ lowercase-with-hyphens: `my-document.md`
  - ❌ ALL CAPS: `MY_DOCUMENT.md`
  - ❌ Underscores: `my_document.md`
  - ❌ Mixed case: `MyDocument.md`

  **Check before committing:**
  ```bash
  git status --short | grep -E "[A-Z]{2,}"

  Exceptions ONLY: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CLAUDE, SKILL,
  LICENSE, CITATION

  ## My Recommendation

  **Implement #1 (pre-commit hook)** - This catches me automatically before
  damage is done. Would you like me to create this hook file for you?

  I'll also commit to #3 (self-checking before commits) - I should be
  running a filename check as part of my commit workflow.

  What do you think? Should I create the pre-commit hook script?

> yes, please create the hook file 

● I'll create the pre-commit hook now:

● Write(.git/hooks/pre-commit)

● Perfect! Pre-commit hook is now installed and working. Here's what was
  created:

  ✅ Pre-Commit Hook Installed

  What it does:
  - Automatically blocks commits with ALL CAPS filenames
  - Scans: .md, .py, .json, .yaml, .yml, .txt files
  - Allows exceptions: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CLAUDE, SKILL,
   LICENSE, CITATION

  Testing results:
  - ✅ Blocks: TEST_FILE.md → Error with helpful message
  - ✅ Allows: README.md → Exception passes through
  - ✅ Allows: test-file.md → Correct style passes

  Files Created

  1. .git/hooks/pre-commit (executable)
    - Active hook blocking violations now
    - Local only (not tracked in git)
  2. scripts/install-git-hooks.sh (committed)
    - Installation script for new clones
    - Recreates hook automatically
    - Usage: ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
  3. .git/hooks/README.md
    - Documentation of hook behaviour
    - Testing instructions
    - Bypass guidance (--no-verify)

  Documentation Updated

  CLAUDE.md - Added "Filename Convention Enforcement" section
  - Clear examples of allowed/blocked filenames
  - Hook installation instructions
  - Reminder that it enforces automatically

  How This Helps

  Before: I could slip into ALL CAPS (10 files renamed today)
  Now: Git blocks me automatically with clear error message
  Result: Consistent lowercase-with-hyphens throughout codebase

  The hook will catch me before the commit goes through, preventing the
  problem at the source rather than fixing it later!

> thank you. what's next, is it to test the classificaiton? If so, I think 
we first need to run a full extraction on Ballsun-Stanton et al 2018? can 
you confirm that is correct? 

● You're absolutely right! Let me check the extraction status of all 3 test
  papers:

● Bash(ls -lh outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2024/*.json 2>/dev/null | grep -v
      "backup")

  ⎿ ./input/sources/original-pdf/Ballsun-Stanton et al. - 2018 - FAIMS Mobi
    le Flexible, open-source software for f.pdf


● Perfect analysis! You're absolutely correct:

  Current Extraction Status

  Ready for classification testing:
  - ✅ sobotkova-et-al-2024: Has extraction.json (119KB)
  - ✅ penske-et-al-2023: Has extraction.json (153KB)

  Needs full extraction:
  - ❌ ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018: Only has
  infrastructure-pass6-extraction.json (23KB)
    - PDF exists: input/sources/original-pdf/Ballsun-Stanton et al. - 2018 -
   FAIMS Mobile Flexible, open-source software for f.pdf
    - No extraction.json (needs claims, evidence, RDMAP arrays for
  classification)

  What the Classifier Needs (Per Error Handling in Pass 8 Prompt)

  The classification prompt explicitly checks for:
  - claims[] array populated
  - methods[] array populated
  - research_designs[] array populated

  If any are missing, it fails fast with: "ERROR: Incomplete extraction.
  Complete Pass 0-6 before running classification (Pass 8)."

  Next Steps

  Option 1: Extract ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 first (recommended)
  - Run full extraction (Passes 0-7)
  - Then test classifier on all 3 papers
  - ~2-3 hours for extraction + testing

  Option 2: Test classifier on 2 papers now
  - Test on sobotkova-et-al-2024 and penske-et-al-2023 only
  - Extract ballsun-stanton later
  - Faster start, but incomplete Step 3 validation

  I recommend Option 1 - complete the extraction first so we get the full
  3-paper test set including the methodological paper (FAIMS is our key test
   case for the paper_type = "methodological" classification path).

  Should I proceed with extracting ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018?
