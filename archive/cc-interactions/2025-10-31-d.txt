● Perfect! All reference searches complete. Now let me create a comprehensive validation report:

  Validation Report

  ✅ Core Objectives Achieved

  Objective (a): Reconcile two copies of WORKFLOW.md
  - Obsolete v2.7.0 from extraction-system/staging/ archived to archive/documentation-archive/WORKFLOW-v2.7.0-OBSOLETE.md with explanatory header
  - Authoritative v3.0.0 in input/WORKFLOW.md retained as single source of truth
  - All references updated to point to input/WORKFLOW.md

  Objective (b): Eliminate 6 recurring clarification issues

  All 6 issues now addressed in WORKFLOW.md "Planning Mode Requirements" section (lines 5-99):

  1. ✅ Skill invocation (WORKFLOW.md:11-16): Mandatory Component #1 with checkbox
  2. ✅ Word-length chunking (WORKFLOW.md:18-29): Mandatory Component #2 with explicit 1000 +/-500, max 1500 words
  3. ✅ Equal attention to entire paper (WORKFLOW.md:45-50): Mandatory Component #5 warning against Methods over-focus
  4. ✅ Same chunking for Pass 1 and Pass 3 (WORKFLOW.md:19): Explicit "ONCE (will be used for BOTH Pass 1 and Pass 3)"
  5. ✅ Liberal over-extraction (WORKFLOW.md:38-43): Mandatory Component #4 with "40-50% over-extraction expected"
  6. ✅ Chunking metadata recording (WORKFLOW.md:52-57): Mandatory Component #6 with specific recording requirements

  Objective (modified): Distill three model plans into unified model
  - Created extraction-system/EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md (1028 lines)
  - Comprehensive 9-part structure covering all paper types
  - Three original plans archived with headers explaining historical value
  - All references updated

  ✅ Files Created

  1. extraction-system/EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md - Flexible planning model with:
    - Part 1: Universal Planning Checklist
    - Part 2: Paper Analysis Framework (empirical/methodological/multi-proxy/short/long)
    - Part 3: Section Structure Planning Guide
    - Part 4-9: Pass-by-pass templates, adaptation guidelines, worked examples
  2. input/EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md - Brief 57-line primer (not prescriptive template)
  3. Five archived files in archive/documentation-archive/:
    - WORKFLOW-v2.7.0-OBSOLETE.md
    - extraction-planning-prompt-FAILED-2025-10-30.md
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_MODEL-penske-2023.md
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_CONNOR_2013.md
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_BALLSUN_STANTON_2022.md

  ✅ Files Modified

  1. input/WORKFLOW.md:
    - Added "Planning Mode Requirements - Read This First" section (lines 5-99)
    - Added 7 mandatory plan components with checkboxes and "Why critical" explanations
    - Added 6 common planning mistakes with problem/impact/fix structure
    - Moved "Autonomous Execution Mode" section earlier (line 118)
    - Strengthened Pass 1 and Pass 3 descriptions with critical planning requirements
  2. CLAUDE.md:
    - Updated pass count from 5 to 7 throughout
    - Replaced single workflow reference with three distinct references
  3. extraction-system/qa-checks.sh:
    - Updated reference from extraction-system/staging/WORKFLOW.md to input/WORKFLOW.md (line 138)
  4. planning/active-todo-list.md:
    - Updated script template from "6-pass" to "7-pass" (line 113)

  ✅ Reference Integrity

  All references validated:
  - No orphaned references to old model plans in active documentation
  - input/queue.yaml historical "6-pass" references are accurate (describe completed extractions)
  - Archive files correctly reference superseding files
  - CLAUDE.md points to all three key files: WORKFLOW.md, EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md, EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md

  ✅ Archive Quality

  All archived files have comprehensive headers including:
  - Archive date (2025-10-31)
  - Original location
  - Superseded by (with path)
  - Archival reason
  - Historical value / lessons learned

  ✅ Structure Validation

  New documentation hierarchy:
  input/
  ├── WORKFLOW.md (v3.0.0, authoritative, planning requirements at top)
  └── EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md (brief primer, 57 lines)

  extraction-system/
  └── EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md (flexible planning model, 1028 lines)

  archive/documentation-archive/
  ├── WORKFLOW-v2.7.0-OBSOLETE.md
  ├── extraction-planning-prompt-FAILED-2025-10-30.md
  └── [3 model plans with historical value preserved]

  Design principles validated:
  - Brief primer (EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md) points to comprehensive documentation
  - Comprehensive documentation (WORKFLOW.md) has planning requirements at top
  - Flexible model (EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md) provides adaptation framework
  - No duplication, no prescriptive templates
  - "Prime thinking, don't prescribe format"

● Summary

  All housekeeping and workflow improvements complete! Here's what was accomplished:

  ✅ Reconciliation Complete

  - Obsolete WORKFLOW.md (v2.7.0) archived from staging/
  - Single authoritative source: input/WORKFLOW.md (v3.0.0)
  - All references updated throughout project

  ✅ Six Recurring Issues Resolved

  WORKFLOW.md now has "Planning Mode Requirements - Read This First" section at the top addressing all your recurring clarifications:

  1. Skill invocation - Now Mandatory Component #1 with explicit "invoke at Pre-Flight, keep throughout"
  2. Word-length chunking - Mandatory Component #2 with explicit "~1000 words, max 1500, must split if exceeded"
  3. Equal attention strategy - Mandatory Component #5 with explicit warning against Methods over-focus
  4. Same sections Pass 1/3 - Explicit "Define section groups ONCE (will be used for BOTH Pass 1 and Pass 3)"
  5. Liberal over-extraction - Mandatory Component #4 with explicit "40-50% over-extraction expected"
  6. Chunking metadata - Mandatory Component #6 with specific recording requirements

  Each component includes:
  - Checkbox for plan verification
  - "Why critical" explanation
  - Specific implementation guidance

  Plus added "Common Planning Mistakes" section with problem/impact/fix structure for each issue.

  ✅ Model Plans Consolidated

  Created: extraction-system/EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md (1028 lines)
  - Universal planning checklist (applies to all papers)
  - Paper type analysis framework (empirical/methodological/multi-proxy/short/long)
  - Adaptation guidelines by type
  - Condensed worked examples from all three original plans

  Archived: Three original model plans with headers explaining their historical value:
  - Penske 2023 (archaeogenetics, 23 pages, 9 sections)
  - Connor 2013 (multi-proxy palaeoecology, 44 pages, 13 sections)
  - Ross & Ballsun-Stanton 2022 (methodological, 19 pages, 5 sections)

  ✅ Launch Prompt Created

  Created: input/EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md (57 lines)
  - Brief primer that points to documentation (not prescriptive template)
  - References all key files (queue.yaml, WORKFLOW.md, unified model)
  - Primes thinking without prescribing format

  Archived: Failed extraction-planning-prompt.md with detailed anti-pattern explanation

  Files Modified

  - input/WORKFLOW.md - Planning requirements at top, autonomous mode moved earlier, strengthened Pass 1/3 descriptions
  - CLAUDE.md - Updated to 7-pass, added three documentation references
  - extraction-system/qa-checks.sh - Updated WORKFLOW.md path
  - planning/active-todo-list.md - Updated to 7-pass

  All changes validated, references checked, archive headers complete. Ready for next extraction!

  Questions for You

  Before archiving anything, please clarify:

  1. Template Usage: Are the *.py templates in extraction-system/scripts/extraction/ actively used to generate per-paper scripts?
  2. Extraction Status: What's the status of:
    - outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2024/
    - outputs/ross-2005/
  3. Architecture Finalization: Is the prompt/skill architecture now stable? If so, prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md can be archived.
  4. Empty Directory: Should docs/development/ be removed or does it serve a purpose?

  Would you like me to proceed with archiving the clearly obsolete items (CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md, todo-assessment-post-run08.md) once you've clarified
  these points?

> (1) Yes, I believe they are in use, do not archive\
(2) Everything in the outputs/ folder is current, do not archive, EXCEPT:   outputs/ross-2005/EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_2005_RUN02.md which can be 
archived\
(3) Yes, it's stable, archive\
(4) Remove if empty\
\
For  planning/future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md - this is still current (needs review and actioning), but can be merged with 'active 
to-do' list.\
\
I think that covers all of your questions, please ask if I missed any 

● Perfect, that covers everything! Let me summarize the actions I'll take:

  Archive/Cleanup Plan

  Will Archive:
  1. planning/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md → archive/planning-completed/
  2. planning/todo-assessment-post-run08.md → archive/planning-completed/
  3. planning/prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md → archive/planning-completed/
  4. outputs/ross-2005/EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_2005_RUN02.md → archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005-RUN-02-partial/ (if that directory exists)
  5. planning/future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md → archive/planning-completed/ (after merging into active-todo-list.md)

  Will Delete:
  6. docs/development/ (if empty)

  Will Modify:
  7. planning/active-todo-list.md - add task about removing Sobotkova-specific metrics

  Let me proceed with these actions:

● Bash(test -d /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/docs/development && ls -la /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/docs/development/ | tail -n +4 | wc
      -l)
  ⎿  0

● Bash(ls -d /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005* 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005-RUN-01-FAIL   
     /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005-RUN-02-partial

● Read(planning/future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md)
  ⎿  Read 141 lines

● Read(planning/active-todo-list.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

● Now I'll merge the Sobotkova-specific metrics task into the active todo list and archive the files:

● Update(planning/active-todo-list.md)
  ⎿  Updated planning/active-todo-list.md with 34 additions and 1 removal

       219 +  ### 5. Remove Sobotkova-Specific Metrics from Prompts/Skill
       220 +  
       221 +  **Priority:** MEDIUM
       222 +  **Status:** DEFERRED until multi-paper testing phase
       223 +  **Effort:** 3-4 hours audit + 2-3 hours refinement
       224 +  
       225 +  **Issue:**
       226 +  Extraction prompts and skill may contain metrics, targets, or patterns calibrated to Sobotkova et al. 2023 rather than 
           + generalizable across diverse fieldwork-based research.
       227 +  
       228 +  **Audit Locations (High Priority):**
       229 +  - [ ] Prompt 03 (RDMAP Pass 1) - Research Design count guidance
       230 +  - [ ] Prompt 04 (RDMAP Pass 2) - Consolidation targets
       231 +  - [ ] Prompt 02 (Claims/Evidence Pass 2) - Consolidation targets
       232 +  - [ ] references/checklists/expected-information.md - Completeness patterns
       233 +  - [ ] .claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md - Any metrics/targets
       234 +  
       235 +  **Audit Locations (Medium Priority):**
       236 +  - [ ] Prompt 01 - Evidence/claims extraction targets
       237 +  - [ ] Prompt 05 - Validation thresholds
       238 +  - [ ] All reference files - Examples and patterns
       239 +  
       240 +  **Actions Needed:**
       241 +  1. Replace specific numbers with principles (e.g., "Expect 4-6 designs" → "Quality over count - if <3 review for under-extraction, 
           + if >10 review for over-extraction")
       242 +  2. Use multiple paper examples where possible, label sources
       243 +  3. Base standards on domain knowledge (TIDieR, CONSORT) not single paper
       244 +  4. Test on 5-10 diverse papers to validate generalizability
       245 +  
       246 +  **When:** After current 10-paper extraction phase, during multi-paper analysis
       247 +  
       248 +  **Original documentation:** Archived in `archive/planning-completed/future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md`

  Archive Cleanup Complete ✅

  Commit: 6ac25e5 - "chore: archive completed planning docs and remove obsolete files"

  Files Archived (4 planning documents → archive/planning-completed/)

  1. CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md - Cleanup task complete, historical record
  2. todo-assessment-post-run08.md - Superseded by active-todo-list.md
  3. prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md - Architecture now stable after 10 extractions
  4. future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md - Merged into active-todo-list.md

  All archived files now have headers with:
  - Archive date (2025-10-31)
  - Original location
  - Superseded by / merged into (where applicable)
  - Archival reason

  Files Archived (1 extraction plan → archive/output/)

  5. ross-2005/EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_2005_RUN02.md → archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005-RUN-02-partial/

  Updated Files

  - planning/active-todo-list.md - Added Section 5: Remove Sobotkova-Specific Metrics (comprehensive task with all audit locations and principles),
  renumbered sections 5→6

  Removed

  - docs/development/ - Empty directory removed

  Kept (per your instructions)

  - All template .py files in extraction-system/scripts/extraction/ (actively used)
  - All current outputs in outputs/ (current extractions)
  - Fellowship and preliminary-work planning (strategic/historical value)

  The repository is now cleaner with completed planning tasks properly archived and documented!

> Ok, something we need to put on the to-do list as a longer-term project is to deal with the extraction of secondary source information (which may 
constitute either claims or evidence - a paper could site previous results as evidence supporting a claim in the paper, or it could take a claim 
from another paper and test it against new evidence, for example). We will, eventually, need to sort that out, but I think that it will need to be 
driven by specific assessment goals, so I am defering it for now. 

● Good point! This is an important methodological issue. Let me add it to the active todo list as a deferred task:

       258 +  **Effort:** TBD (requires methodological design)
       259 +  
       260 +  **Issue:**
       261 +  Current extraction does not systematically distinguish the role of secondary sources (citations to previous work). A cited source 
           + can function as:
       262 +  
       263 +  1. **Evidence supporting a claim in current paper** - "Previous results show X [citation], which supports our interpretation that 
           + Y"
       264 +  2. **Claim being tested/evaluated** - "Smith (2020) claims X, but our new evidence suggests Y"
       265 +  3. **Background/context** - General citation for established knowledge
       266 +  
       267 +  **Current State:**
       268 +  - Citations are captured in verbatim_quote fields when they appear in extracted items
       269 +  - No systematic tracking of citation role or source attribution
       270 +  - No distinction between primary evidence (generated by current paper) vs secondary evidence (cited from other papers)
       271 +  
       272 +  **Future Requirements (to be determined by assessment goals):**
       273 +  - [ ] Define citation role taxonomy (evidence/claim/background/other)
       274 +  - [ ] Determine if secondary source metadata should be structured (author, year, DOI)
       275 +  - [ ] Decide if cited claims need separate extraction from paper's own claims
       276 +  - [ ] Consider provenance tracking (chain of evidence across papers)

● Perfect! Added to the active todo list as Section 6: Secondary Source Attribution and Role Classification under "Deferred / Future Projects".

  Commit: 6473cc0 - "docs: add secondary source attribution task to active todo list"

  The task documents:

  The Issue: Citations can serve different roles:
  1. Evidence supporting current paper's claims
  2. Claims being tested against new evidence
  3. Background/context

  Current State:
  - Citations captured in verbatim_quote fields
  - No systematic role tracking
  - No primary vs secondary source distinction

  Deferred Until: Phase 2 assessment framework development defines concrete requirements

  Future Considerations:
  - Citation role taxonomy
  - Structured secondary source metadata (author, year, DOI)
  - Potential schema extensions (citation_role, source_type, cited_work)
  - Provenance tracking across papers

  This is well-positioned as an assessment-driven enhancement - you'll know what you need once you have specific credibility/transparency assessment
   goals. Good call deferring it!

> do you have any thoughts on the distinction, and how to assess it? I'd like to brainstorm some aspects of a starting point while recent 
extractions are fresh in our minds 

● Great idea to brainstorm while it's fresh! Let me think through this with examples from the recent extractions.

  Observations from Recent Extractions

  Citation patterns vary by paper type:

  1. Methodological papers (Ross & Ballsun-Stanton 2022):
    - Heavy citation building argumentative claims
    - Literature evidence used to support methodological arguments
    - Citations often function as "here's the problem others identified"
  2. Empirical papers (Penske et al. 2023, Connor et al. 2013):
    - Method provenance: "qpAdm (Haak et al. 2015)"
    - Comparative evidence: "Our pollen assemblages differ from those reported by Smith (2018)"
    - Interpretive context: "This pattern is consistent with regional climate shifts (Jones et al. 2020)"
  3. Literary/theoretical (Ross 2005):
    - Engaging with scholarly interpretations
    - Citations as claims being argued against
    - "Smith (1995) argues X, but the textual evidence suggests Y"

  Practical Taxonomy (Draft)

  For Evidence Items

  source_type field:
  - primary - Generated/collected by current paper (measurements, observations, new data)
  - secondary - Results cited from other papers used as evidence
  - hybrid - Re-analysis of published data (e.g., existing databases, repositories)

  Example distinctions:
  - PRIMARY: "We obtained 47 new radiocarbon dates from the site"
  - SECONDARY: "Previous excavations yielded dates of 4500-4200 BCE (Smith 2018)" [used as comparative evidence]
  - HYBRID: "Re-analysis of published genetic data (1000 Genomes Project) using updated methods"

  For Claims

  claim_origin field:
  - novel - New interpretation/conclusion from current paper
  - tested - Claim from literature being evaluated/challenged
  - supported - Claim from literature being corroborated by new evidence
  - synthesized - Integration of current findings + cited work

  Example distinctions:
  - NOVEL: "Our results indicate early contact between farming and pastoralist populations by 4500 BCE"
  - TESTED: "Contrary to Smith's (2015) claim of genetic isolation, we find evidence of admixture"
  - SUPPORTED: "As proposed by Jones (2018), the pollen data confirm regional deforestation"
  - SYNTHESIZED: "Combining our dates with those of Brown (2019), the transition spans 300 years"

  For Methods/Protocols

  method_provenance field:
  - original - Developed in current paper
  - adapted - Modified from cited work (need to extract what was modified)
  - standard - Direct application of established method with citation
  - comparative - Multiple methods compared

  Example distinctions:
  - ORIGINAL: "We developed a new Bayesian model for..."
  - ADAPTED: "Modified the qpAdm approach of Haak et al. (2015) by adding..."
  - STANDARD: "Pollen extracted following Faegri & Iversen (1989)"
  - COMPARATIVE: "We compared results from three dating methods (Smith 2010, Jones 2012, Brown 2015)"

  Assessment Dimensions This Would Enable

  1. Transparency Assessment

  Questions:
  - Does the paper clearly distinguish new claims from cited claims?
  - Is evidence provenance clear (primary vs secondary)?
  - Are methods properly attributed?

  Metrics:
  - % of claims with clear origin attribution
  - % of evidence marked as primary vs secondary
  - Citation transparency score

  2. Novelty/Contribution Assessment

  Questions:
  - What proportion of claims are genuinely novel?
  - How much depends on re-interpretation vs new data?

  Metrics:
  - Novel claims / total claims
  - Primary evidence / total evidence
  - Ratio of novel to tested/supported claims

  3. Evidence Chain Integrity

  Questions:
  - Can you trace claims back to primary sources?
  - How many citation hops to primary evidence?
  - Are secondary sources used appropriately?

  Metrics:
  - Citation depth (hops to primary source)
  - Proportion of claims supported by primary (not secondary) evidence
  - Misattribution risk (secondary sources treated as primary)

  4. Citational Practice Quality

  Questions:
  - Are citations used accurately for their stated role?
  - Is there citation inflation (unnecessary citations)?
  - Are key sources missing?

  Metrics:
  - Citation role accuracy (if verifiable)
  - Citation necessity (background vs essential)

  Practical Extraction Challenges

  Ambiguity issues I've encountered:

  1. Synthesis claims are very common:
    - "Our dates (4500-4200 BCE) align with those from nearby sites (Smith 2018: 4400-4100 BCE), suggesting regional synchronicity"
    - Is this novel, supported, or synthesized? It's all three!
  2. Implicit vs explicit attribution:
    - "The genetic data show admixture" - Novel claim based on primary evidence
    - "Genetic admixture is evident" - Could be novel OR restating cited consensus
    - Context required, often subtle
  3. Method chains:
    - "We used qpAdm (Haak 2015) implemented in ADMIXTOOLS (Patterson 2012) with parameters from Lazaridis (2016)"
    - Standard? Adapted? Multiple sources to track?
  4. Background vs evidence citations:
    - "Climate change occurred during this period (Smith 2015, Jones 2017, Brown 2019)"
    - Is this evidence supporting a claim, or background context?
    - Often depends on argumentative role in the paper

  Proposed Starting Point

  Phase 1: Simple Addition (Low Complexity)

  Add optional fields to existing schema:

  {
    "evidence_id": "E001",
    "evidence_type": "quantitative_data",
    "source_type": "primary",  // NEW: primary/secondary/hybrid
    "verbatim_quote": "...",
    "page": 5
  }

  {
    "claim_id": "C001",
    "claim_type": "interpretation",
    "claim_origin": "novel",  // NEW: novel/tested/supported/synthesized
    "verbatim_quote": "...",
    "page": 8
  }

  Extraction approach:
  - During Pass 1, flag obvious cases (clearly primary evidence, explicitly tested claims)
  - Leave ambiguous cases unmarked
  - No requirement for 100% coverage initially
  - Learn from patterns across multiple papers

  Phase 2: Structured Citation Metadata (Medium Complexity)

  Add structured citation tracking:

  {
    "claim_id": "C001",
    "claim_origin": "tested",
    "cited_claim": {
      "source": "Smith 2015",
      "claim_text": "genetic isolation throughout Copper Age",
      "relationship": "contradicted_by_current_evidence"
    }
  }

  Relationships:
  - supports_claim - Citation supports current paper's claim
  - contradicted_by_current_evidence - Claim being challenged
  - corroborated_by_current_evidence - Claim being supported
  - method_source - Citation for method used
  - comparative_data - Cited data for comparison

  Phase 3: Full Provenance Tracking (High Complexity)

  Track evidence chains across papers:

  {
    "evidence_id": "E001",
    "source_type": "secondary",
    "cited_evidence": {
      "source_paper": "Jones 2018",
      "evidence_type": "radiocarbon_dates",
      "primary_source": "Jones 2018",  // Could trace further back
      "doi": "10.1234/example",
      "reliability_flags": ["peer_reviewed", "published_data_available"]
    }
  }

  Assessment-Driven Decision Points

  Questions to answer before implementing:

  1. What specific assessment goals require this?
    - RepliCATS-style credibility scoring?
    - Transparency tier assignment?
    - Evidence strength weighting?
  2. What's the extraction burden vs assessment value?
    - Simple source_type field: Low burden, moderate value
    - Full provenance tracking: High burden, uncertain value until we know assessment needs
  3. How do we handle ambiguity?
    - Allow "unclear" values?
    - Multiple role tags (e.g., both "novel" and "synthesized")?
    - Confidence scores?
  4. Testing approach:
    - Extract 2-3 papers with different citation patterns
    - Try the simple taxonomy
    - See what breaks, what's easy, what's actually useful for assessment

  My Recommendation

  Start conservative:
  1. Pick 2-3 completed extractions with different profiles (methodological, empirical, theory-heavy)
  2. Manually code 10-15 claims and evidence items each for source_type and claim_origin
  3. Document ambiguous cases and resolution strategies
  4. Assess: Does this categorization actually help with assessment goals?
  5. Only then decide if it's worth schema extension and automated extraction

  Key question to answer first:
  What would you do with this information in your assessment framework? If the answer is "compare transparency of primary vs secondary source
  attribution" or "weight claims by novelty", then it's worth pursuing. If it's "nice to have but not sure how to use it", defer until assessment
  goals crystallize.

  What assessment dimensions are you most interested in? That might help focus where to start.

       261 +  
       262 +  **Issue Summary:**
       263    Current extraction does not systematically distinguish the role of secondary sources (citations to previous work). A cited source 
             can function as:
       264    
       265    1. **Evidence supporting a claim in current paper** - "Previous results show X [citation], which supports our interpretation that 
             Y"

       265    3. **Background/context** - General citation for established knowledge
       266    
       267    **Current State:**
       268 -  - Citations are captured in verbatim_quote fields when they appear in extracted items

  Commit: 1f49e85 - "docs: add comprehensive secondary source attribution analysis"

  The analysis document now captures:
  - Observations from your recent 10 extractions
  - Draft taxonomy for evidence/claims/methods
  - 4 assessment dimensions this would enable
  - 4 major extraction challenges with examples
  - 3 implementation phases with effort estimates
  - Recommended pilot approach (4-6 hours on 2-3 papers)
  - Key decision point: "What would you DO with this information?"

  The active todo list Section 6 now references this document for detailed analysis, keeping the todo list concise while preserving all the
  brainstorming work.

  You can revisit this when Phase 2 assessment framework design clarifies what citation role tracking you actually need. Good to have it documented
  while the extraction patterns are fresh!

● Session Summary: Workflow Documentation Consolidation and Planning

  Completed Work

  1. Workflow Documentation Consolidation (Commits: 7c2f128, 6ac25e5, 6473cc0, 1f49e85)

  Reconciled WORKFLOW.md copies:
  - Archived obsolete v2.7.0 from extraction-system/staging/ → archive/documentation-archive/WORKFLOW-v2.7.0-OBSOLETE.md
  - Single authoritative source: input/WORKFLOW.md (v3.0.0, 7-pass workflow)

  Eliminated 6 recurring planning issues by adding "Planning Mode Requirements - Read This First" section to input/WORKFLOW.md (lines 5-99):
  1. Skill invocation (research-assessor throughout extraction) - Mandatory Component #1
  2. Word-length chunking (1000 ±500 words, max 1500) - Mandatory Component #2
  3. Equal attention to entire paper (not over-focus on Methods) - Mandatory Component #5
  4. Same sections for Pass 1 and Pass 3 - Explicit in Component #2
  5. Liberal over-extraction approach (40-50%) - Mandatory Component #4
  6. Chunking metadata recording - Mandatory Component #6

  Each component includes checkbox, "Why critical" explanation, and "Common Planning Mistakes" section with problem/impact/fix structure.

  Consolidated three model extraction plans:
  - Created extraction-system/EXTRACTION_PLAN_UNIFIED_MODEL.md (1028 lines) - flexible planning model for diverse paper types
  - Archived three paper-specific plans with historical value preserved:
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_MODEL-penske-2023.md (archaeogenetics, 23 pages)
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_CONNOR_2013.md (multi-proxy palaeoecology, 44 pages)
    - EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_BALLSUN_STANTON_2022.md (methodological, 19 pages)

  Created extraction launch prompt:
  - input/EXTRACTION_LAUNCH.md (57 lines) - brief primer pointing to documentation, not prescriptive template
  - Archived failed extraction-planning-prompt.md as anti-pattern with detailed explanation

  Updated references throughout:
  - CLAUDE.md - Updated to 7-pass workflow, added three documentation references
  - extraction-system/qa-checks.sh - Updated WORKFLOW.md path
  - planning/active-todo-list.md - Updated to 7-pass

  2. Repository Cleanup

  Archived 5 files (all with explanatory headers):
  1. planning/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md → archive/planning-completed/ (cleanup task complete)
  2. planning/todo-assessment-post-run08.md → archive/planning-completed/ (superseded by active-todo-list.md)
  3. planning/prompt-vs-skill-division-guidance.md → archive/planning-completed/ (architecture now stable)
  4. planning/future-task-remove-sobotkova-specific-metrics.md → archive/planning-completed/ (merged into active-todo-list.md)
  5. outputs/ross-2005/EXTRACTION_PLAN_ROSS_2005_RUN02.md → archive/output/cc-sonnet45/ross-2005-RUN-02-partial/

  Removed: docs/development/ (empty directory)

  Updated active-todo-list.md:
  - Merged Sobotkova-specific metrics task into Section 5 (comprehensive audit locations, principles for generalisability)
  - Added Section 6: Secondary Source Attribution and Role Classification (deferred)

  3. Secondary Source Attribution Analysis

  Created planning/secondary-source-attribution-analysis.md (541 lines):

  Observations from 10 recent extractions:
  - Citation patterns by paper type (methodological/empirical/literary)
  - Different roles citations play across disciplines

  Proposed taxonomy:
  - Evidence: source_type (primary/secondary/hybrid)
  - Claims: claim_origin (novel/tested/supported/synthesised)
  - Methods: method_provenance (original/adapted/standard/comparative)

  Assessment dimensions enabled:
  - Transparency assessment (provenance clarity)
  - Novelty/contribution assessment (primary vs secondary evidence ratio)
  - Evidence chain integrity (citation depth, misattribution risk)
  - Citational practice quality

  Extraction challenges documented:
  - Synthesis claims (multiple simultaneous roles)
  - Implicit vs explicit attribution
  - Method citation chains
  - Background vs evidence citations

  Implementation phases:
  - Phase 1: Simple optional fields (6-7 hours)
  - Phase 2: Structured citation metadata (15-18 hours)
  - Phase 3: Full provenance tracking (34-44 hours)

  Recommendation: Defer until Phase 2 assessment framework defines specific needs, then run pilot study (4-6 hours) on 2-3 papers before committing
  to implementation.
