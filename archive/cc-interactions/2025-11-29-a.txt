  Completed This Session

  1. Code Repository Verification
  - User correctly recalled sobotkova-et-al-2024 has 3 GitHub repositories
  - Extraction.json captured them correctly, but Cluster 1 assessment missed 
them
  - Corrected Transparency score: 72 → 78

  2. Cluster 1 Reliability Testing
  - Ran 3 independent assessments on sobotkova-et-al-2024
  - Results: Comprehensibility 78/76/77 (SD=0.82), Transparency 78/77/79 
(SD=0.82)
  - Excellent reliability - well below 10-point threshold
  - Commits: e8d5f8c, 7e1f1a5

  3. Root Cause Analysis & Fix
  - Found structural prompt error: Cluster 1 directed to evidence[] for 
code/data
  - Correct location: reproducibility_infrastructure.code_availability
  - Fixed both prompt AND skill with explicit path guidance
  - Commit: 146c309

  4. QA Check for Similar Errors
  - Checked 3 remaining assessment prompts
  - All clean - error was isolated to Cluster 1
  - Results documented in plan file

  Phase 7 Status

  Steps 1-6 complete. Step 7 next: Create remaining cluster prompts (Cluster 2, 
Cluster 3, synthesis).

  Next Session Actions

  1. Create cluster-2-evidential-strength.md (Plausibility + Validity + 
Robustness)
  2. Create cluster-3-reproducibility-scope.md (Replicability + 
Generalisability)
  3. Create credibility-synthesis.md (final report generation)
  4. Important: Use reproducibility_infrastructure.* paths (not evidence[]) for 
code/data references

  Critical Lesson Learned

  When assessing Transparency signal, always check:
  - reproducibility_infrastructure.code_availability
  - reproducibility_infrastructure.data_availability
  - reproducibility_infrastructure.persistent_identifiers

  NOT evidence[] - that's for observational data, not infrastructure.

> Hi CC, welcome back, can you remind me what the Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 
prompts do? 

● Based on the plan file and skill reference:

  Cluster 2: Evidential Strength

  Assesses three signals:
  - Plausibility - Are the claims consistent with existing knowledge and
  theory?
  - Validity - Do the methods actually measure what they claim to measure?
  - Robustness - How sensitive are conclusions to analytical choices?

  Cluster 3: Reproducibility & Scope

  Assesses two signals:
  - Replicability - Can others reproduce the analytical outputs given the
  same inputs? (For HASS: analytic reproducibility, not field replication)
  - Generalisability - How far do findings extend beyond the specific study
  context?

  The Seven Signals Overall

  | Cluster                     | Signals                            | Focus
                                                 |
  |-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------
  -----------------------------------------------|
  | 1 - Foundational Clarity    | Comprehensibility, Transparency    | Can
  you understand and verify what was done?        |
  | 2 - Evidential Strength     | Plausibility, Validity, Robustness | Is
  the evidence sound?                              |
  | 3 - Reproducibility & Scope | Replicability, Generalisability    | Can
  it be reproduced and how broadly does it apply? |

  Each cluster prompt follows the same pattern as Cluster 1:
  - Signal-specific scoring (0-100)
  - Approach-specific anchors (deductive/inductive/abductive)
  - Evidence citations from extraction.json
  - Cluster-level synthesis

  These are the remaining deliverables for Step 7 of Phase 7.

> Great - one suggestion, for 'Cluster 3' the terminology we should probably
 use is 'reproducibility' / 'reproduce' rather than 'replicability' / 
'replicate', and for the qualifier: 'HASS: analytic or computational 
reproducibility, not beginning-to-end reproducibility or replication of the 
fieldwork or other research overall'. Essentially, what we are doing here 
is: (a) assess the *transparency* and reliability / credibility / 
generalisability / etc. of the overall research, and test the 
*reproducibility* of computational or analyitical components of that 
research. *That* division places reasonable and domain-aligned expectations 
on the research we will be examining, and we should adapt what we borrow 
from repliCATS and other sources to conform to reaslistic expectations in 
our domains. I think your approach is basically correct, but I wanted to 
make this split between what we can reasonably hope to reprocude and what we
 can't and must judge on transparency and credibility explicit. 

● This is an important clarification. Let me restate to confirm I
  understand:

  The Two-Part Assessment Framework

  What we assess on transparency/credibility (cannot reproduce):
  - Fieldwork execution
  - Primary data collection
  - Site-specific observations
  - Ethnographic encounters
  - Overall research design decisions

  What we assess on reproducibility (can potentially reproduce):
  - Computational workflows
  - Statistical analyses
  - Data transformations
  - Analytical pipelines
  - Code execution

  Terminology Correction for Cluster 3

  | Current                                           | Should Be

                                            |
  |---------------------------------------------------|---------------------
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------|
  | Replicability                                     | Reproducibility

                                            |
  | "analytic reproducibility, not field replication" | "analytic or
  computational reproducibility, not beginning-to-end reproducibility or
  replication of fieldwork or other research overall" |

  Implication for Signal Design

  The Reproducibility signal in Cluster 3 should ask:
  - "Given the data and code, can someone else run the analysis and get the
  same results?"

  NOT:
  - "Can someone repeat the entire study from scratch?"

  This aligns with realistic HASS expectations and positions the assessment
  appropriately between what repliCATS does for laboratory science and
  what's actually achievable in archaeology, palaeoecology, ethnography,
  etc.

  Shall I update the skill reference and plan documents to reflect this
  terminology before we create the Cluster 3 prompt? This would ensure
  consistency across the system.

> Yes, I think you've got it. Essentially, for data transformation, 
statistical analyses, and other computable actions, we should be able to 
take the inputs (e.g., data, etc.) and the code and produce the output 
(e.g., statistical output, transformed data, etc.). In many (most?) cases, 
this will represent only a component of the paper, not the entire paper. 
Some papers won't have a computable component at all (e.g., lit reviews, 
software papers). We also need to do the baseline 'transparency' (includung 
reliability / credibility and generalisabilty) study on the computable 
aspects of the research, BUT we can ALSO look at more formal reproducability
 of the computable parts. Looking ahead, we will want to *actually be able 
to execute the reproduction* and essentially we're pre-assessing whether we 
(or anyone else) can actually do that - it will eventually (a) have value in
 its own right, and (b) be a gateway for a child process where we try to run
 the reproduction (get the input, run the code, reproduce the output). Does 
that make sense? Ask any follow up questiosn you have then we'll update 
effected documents, skill reference,etc. 

● Yes, that makes sense. The Reproducibility signal is essentially a
  pre-assessment for actual reproduction - evaluating whether the
  computational components could be executed by someone else (including,
  eventually, an automated pipeline).

  A few clarifying questions:

  1. Papers Without Computational Components

  For papers like literature reviews, theoretical papers, or software papers
   (describing but not empirically validating):
  - Score Reproducibility as N/A with explanation?
  - Or use different anchors focused on "methodological transparency"
  instead?

  2. What Counts as "Computational Component"?

  Is the boundary:
  - Narrow: Only code-based analysis (Python, R, scripts)
  - Medium: Any quantitative analysis (including SPSS, Excel formulas)
  - Broad: Any systematic analytical procedure with defined steps (including
   manual coding schemes, typology assignments)

  My instinct: Medium - if there's a defined input→transformation→output
  that could theoretically be automated or re-executed, it counts.

  3. Reproducibility Readiness Checklist

  Should the signal output include a structured "gateway" assessment for
  future automation? Something like:

  reproducibility_readiness:
    inputs_available: true|false|partial
    code_available: true|false|partial
    environment_specified: true|false|partial
    outputs_documented: true|false|partial
    execution_feasibility: "ready|needs_work|not_feasible"

  This would feed directly into a future child process that attempts actual
  reproduction.

  4. Relationship to Transparency

  Am I correct that:
  - Transparency (Cluster 1) = "Did they document what they did?"
  - Reproducibility (Cluster 3) = "Can we actually re-execute the
  computational parts?"

  These overlap but aren't identical - a paper could be transparent about
  methods but not provide the code/data needed to reproduce.

> (1) yes, we should have a 'transparency + reliability/credibility' signal 
that we can pick up for all components of all papers; (2) I agree with your 
'medium' scope - with demerits for papers that use GUI-based systems like 
Excel for statistical analyses unless they've taken measures necessary to 
reproduce (published input data and provided step-by-step guidance through 
the analytical process such that a human or an AI with tool use capable of 
manipulated (e.g.) Excel could step through the process). Some analytical 
workflows might be entirely reproduceble *if* access to proprietary software
 (SPSS; Stata) is available, these should also be demerited for use of 
closed tools, but less so. (3) I *love* this reproducibility readiness 
checklist, that's a *great* idea and will be useful in several ways. (4) 
yes, that seems appropriate, transparency is about documenting what they 
did, but extends into publication of datasets, software, etc., so the latter
 gets a transparency scopre *plus* later it is important for reproducibilty.
 Somewhere in between is 'credibility / reliability', where we assess not 
just *whether* they documented what they did and related artefacts, but also
 make an assessment of *how well they did it*. Does this make sense? 
Continue to ask questions as needed until you're confident we are on the 
same page and you understand (I think you're getting it) 

● Yes, I think I'm getting it. Let me articulate the layered structure as I
  understand it:

  The Assessment Layers

  | Layer                   | Question                                     |
   Applies To                    | Output                      |
  |-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
  -------------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | Transparency            | Did they document and publish what they did? |
   All components, all papers    | Score + evidence            |
  | Credibility/Reliability | How well did they do it?                     |
   All components, all papers    | Score + evidence            |
  | Reproducibility         | Can we actually re-execute?                  |
   Computational components only | Score + readiness checklist |

  So transparency is necessary but not sufficient - a paper could publish
  code that's poorly written or data that's inadequately documented.
  Credibility/reliability assesses the quality of what's available.

  Tool-Based Demerits for Reproducibility

  | Tool Type                       | Examples               | Demerit     |
   Rationale                                   |
  |---------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
  ---------------------------------------------|
  | Open + scriptable               | Python, R              | None        |
   Ideal for reproduction                      |
  | Proprietary + scriptable        | SPSS, Stata            | Moderate    |
   Reproducible if software available          |
  | GUI-based without documentation | Excel, manual          | Significant |
   Requires step-by-step guidance to reproduce |
  | GUI-based with documentation    | Excel + detailed steps | Reduced     |
   Human/AI could step through                 |

  Clarifying Question: Where Does Credibility/Reliability Sit?

  In the current Seven Signals structure:
  - Cluster 2 (Plausibility, Validity, Robustness) seems to cover "how well
  did they do it"
  - Is that where credibility/reliability lives?

  Or are you suggesting we need to make this more explicit - perhaps by:
  (a) Renaming Cluster 2 to emphasise credibility assessment?
  (b) Adding credibility/reliability as a cross-cutting concern that informs
   multiple signals?
  (c) Restructuring how we talk about what each cluster does?

  I want to make sure the terminology in our prompts accurately reflects
  this layered model.

> Yes, and 'credibility' extends beyond (good/bad) data and (good/bad) code,
 to appropriateness of methods, presence of evidence support claims, etc. - 
the core of what we're ultimately trying to asses. Yes, Cluster 2 covers 
credibility/reliability - it isn't something new I'm introducing now, it's 
the core of what we are working towards. I don't think we *have to* rename 
unless this nomenclature of 
transparency-credibility/reliability-reproducibility is helpful to 
understanding what we do. Plausibility, validity, robustness, etc., all 
contribute to credibility. We should, however, write up the outcomes of this
 conversatoin as metadata / paradata / documentation about what we are 
doing, it's been an important and clarifying discussion. Do you think that 
elements of this discussion and the nomenclature we're developing would help
 with the prompts? Again, it's not intended to be something new, just 
explicit articulation / categorisation of the work we have been doing from 
the beginning, from extracting claims, evidence, and methods to analysing 
them. Signals essentially get routed to 'transparency' (work is well 
documented and preliminary / intermediate artefacts published - 'show your 
work'; 'the process is the product'), credibility / reliability (the core of
 what we are doing, how much faith can we put in the results of this 
research?) and reproducibility (can a human or AI reproduce 
computational/analytical aspects of the research independently). 

● Yes, this is clarifying rather than new. It's a useful taxonomy for what
  we've been building:

  The Three Pillars

  | Pillar          | Core Question                                   |
  Motto                                           | Signals
                         |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----
  --------------------------------------------|-----------------------------
  -------------------|
  | Transparency    | Is the work documented and artefacts published? |
  "Show your work" / "The process is the product" | Comprehensibility,
  Transparency                |
  | Credibility     | How much faith can we put in the results?       | Core
   assessment goal                            | Plausibility, Validity,
  Robustness             |
  | Reproducibility | Can computational aspects be re-executed?       |
  Independent verification                        | Reproducibility (+
  Generalisability for scope) |

  This maps cleanly onto the clusters:
  - Cluster 1 → Transparency pillar
  - Cluster 2 → Credibility pillar
  - Cluster 3 → Reproducibility pillar (+ scope)

  Value for Prompts

  Yes, I think this nomenclature would help. It provides:
  - Conceptual grounding for what each cluster is really assessing
  - Clear purpose when scoring signals ("am I assessing transparency,
  credibility, or reproducibility here?")
  - Consistent framing across all cluster prompts

  Proposed Documentation

  I suggest capturing this in:
  1. A new reference file: references/credibility/assessment-pillars.md -
  the conceptual framework
  2. Updated SKILL.md: Brief mention linking to the reference
  3. Cluster prompt headers: Each prompt opens with its pillar context

  Shall I draft the assessment-pillars.md reference document first, then
  update the skill and use it to inform the remaining cluster prompts?
