> I'd like to follow up on a couple of things about this paper. First, can you look at the PDF in inputs and 
read the authors and source journal? 

● Read(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/input/sources/original-pdf/Ross et al. - 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological
       Prospection in Apulia, Italy.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (4.2MB)

● I can see the issue now. Looking at the actual PDF:

  Correct Information:

  - Authors: Shawn A. Ross, Adela Sobotkova, and Gert-Jan Burgers
  - Source: Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 34, No. 4 (Winter, 2009), pp. 423-437
  - Publisher: Maney Publishing

  What I incorrectly wrote in summary.md:

  - Authors: Ross, S., Lozny, L., Lim, S., & Cline, E.
  - Source: Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 423-437

  This is a significant error. The authors I listed are completely wrong - Samsung Lim is actually mentioned in
   the acknowledgments as someone who helped with georeferencing, not as an author. I also got the journal name
   wrong.

  I should correct the summary.md file. Would you like me to fix this error now?

> Yes, correct the error, but do you have any suggesitons on how we can reliably extract basic paper metadata? 
We've been focusing on extractoin and haven't discussed this before, but we need to avoid major errors like 
this. 

● Yes, let me fix the error first, then I'll provide recommendations.

● Recommendations for Reliable Metadata Extraction

  Here's what I suggest to prevent this type of error:

  1. Add Pass 0: Metadata Extraction (Pre-flight)

  Before the current pre-flight analysis, add a dedicated metadata extraction step:

  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  """
  Pass 0: Extract Paper Metadata
  Systematically extract bibliographic information from title page.
  """

  # Read first 2-3 pages only
  # Extract structured fields:
  # - title
  # - authors (array)
  # - journal/venue
  # - volume, issue, pages
  # - year
  # - DOI (if present)
  # - publisher

  2. Store Metadata Separately in extraction.json

  Add a top-level paper_metadata section:

  {
    "paper_metadata": {
      "title": "Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy",
      "authors": [
        {
          "name": "Shawn A. Ross",
          "affiliation": "The University of New South Wales"
        },
        {
          "name": "Adela Sobotkova",
          "affiliation": "The University of Michigan"
        },
        {
          "name": "Gert-Jan Burgers",
          "affiliation": "The Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome"
        }
      ],
      "venue": {
        "journal": "Journal of Field Archaeology",
        "volume": "34",
        "issue": "4",
        "season": "Winter",
        "year": "2009",
        "pages": "423-437",
        "publisher": "Maney Publishing",
        "doi": null
      },
      "extraction_date": "2025-10-30",
      "extracted_by": "research-assessor v2.5"
    },
    "evidence": [...],
    ...
  }

  3. Cross-validation with Filename

  Use the filename as a sanity check:
  - Filename: Ross et al. - 2009 - Remote Sensing...
  - Extracted first author: Ross ✓
  - Extracted year: 2009 ✓
  - Flag mismatches for user review

  4. Human Verification Prompt

  After Pass 0, display metadata and ask user to confirm:

  PASS 0 COMPLETE - Metadata Extraction
  ====================================
  Title: Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy
  Authors: Shawn A. Ross, Adela Sobotkova, Gert-Jan Burgers
  Journal: Journal of Field Archaeology
  Year: 2009, Vol. 34(4), pp. 423-437

  Does this look correct? [Y/n]

  5. Structured Extraction Prompts

  When extracting metadata, use explicit field-by-field prompts:

  - "Extract the complete paper title from the title page"
  - "Extract ALL author names with full first names (not initials)"
  - "Extract the journal name exactly as printed"
  - "Extract volume, issue, and page numbers"

  6. PDF Metadata Extraction

  Many PDFs have embedded metadata. We could use pdfinfo or Python libraries:

  pdfinfo "Ross et al. - 2009 - Remote Sensing.pdf" | grep -E "Title|Author|Subject"

  7. Update WORKFLOW.md

  Add Pass 0 to the standard workflow:

  ## 6-Pass Extraction Workflow

  ### Pass 0: Metadata Extraction (NEW)
  **Input:** PDF first 2-3 pages
  **Output:** paper_metadata.json
  **Purpose:** Capture accurate bibliographic information
  **Validation:** Cross-check with filename, user confirmation
  **Time:** 1-2 minutes

  ### Pass 1: Liberal Claims/Evidence Extraction
  ...

  Proposed Implementation

  Would you like me to:

  1. Create a pass0_metadata_extraction.py template?
  2. Update the schema in extraction.json to include a paper_metadata section?
  3. Update WORKFLOW.md to document this step?
  4. Modify the pre-flight script to extract and validate metadata first?

  This approach would ensure we never have incorrect author/journal information again, since it would be:
  - Extracted systematically from the title page only
  - Validated against the filename
  - Confirmed by the user before proceeding
  - Stored in a structured format

  What do you think? Should I implement this for future extractions?

> I agree with:\
  1. Add Pass 0: Metadata Extraction (Pre-flight)\
2. Store Metadata Separately in extraction.json\
  5. Structured Extraction Prompts\
 6. PDF Metadata Extraction (as a cross-check if available, I can't guarantee it will always be present)\
\
I don't want to have a manual approval step since I'm trying to automate extraction as much as possible, and we
 can't count on filenames - I name my files this way, but we may see any sort of filename in future. Please 
develop a plan based on this feedback. 

● I'll research the current workflow structure and schema, then develop a comprehensive plan for implementing
  Pass 0 metadata extraction.

● User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Implementation Plan: Pass 0 Metadata Extraction

     Overview

     Add a systematic Pass 0 metadata extraction step to the 6-pass workflow to ensure accurate bibliographic 
     information is captured for every paper before content extraction begins.

     Components to Implement

     1. Create Pass 0 Metadata Extraction Prompt

     File: extraction-system/prompts/00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md

     Purpose: Provide structured guidance for extracting bibliographic metadata from the first 2-3 pages of the
      PDF.

     Key sections:
     - Extract from title page ONLY (not acknowledgments, not later author mentions)
     - Field-by-field extraction instructions:
       - paper_title: Complete title from title page
       - authors: Array of full author names (Firstname Lastname format, NOT initials)
       - publication_year: Integer year from citation
       - journal: Exact journal name as printed
       - doi: DOI if present, null if not
       - paper_type: Classify as research article/review/methods paper/etc.
       - discipline: Primary discipline (archaeology/ethnography/etc.)
       - research_context: 1-2 sentence summary of research topic/location
     - Extraction strategy: Prioritize title page > JSTOR header > PDF metadata
     - Validation rules: Cross-check year/authors across title page and abstract
     - Output format: JSON object matching project_metadata schema

     2. Update WORKFLOW.md

     File: input/WORKFLOW.md

     Changes:
     - Rename current "Pre-Flight" to "Pre-Flight: Initialization"
     - Add new "Pass 0: Metadata Extraction" section between Pre-Flight and Pass 1
     - Update pass numbering context (now 7 passes total: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
     - Document Pass 0 inputs/outputs/validation
     - Add note about using pdfinfo as cross-check when available

     Pass 0 section content:
     ### Pass 0: Metadata Extraction
     **Input:** First 2-3 pages of PDF
     **Output:** project_metadata object in extraction.json
     **Purpose:** Capture accurate bibliographic information
     **Validation:** 
       - All 8 project_metadata fields populated
       - Authors in full name format (not initials)
       - Cross-check with pdfinfo metadata if available
     **Time:** 2-3 minutes
     **Note:** Proceeds automatically to Pass 1, no user confirmation

     3. Create Pass 0 Execution Script Template

     File: outputs/{slug}/pass0_metadata_extraction.py

     Purpose: Provide reusable template for metadata extraction execution

     Script structure:
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     """
     Pass 0: Metadata Extraction
     {Paper Title} - {Authors} - {Year}

     Extract bibliographic metadata from title page and populate project_metadata.
     """

     import json
     from datetime import datetime, timezone
     from pathlib import Path
     import subprocess

     # Read PDF metadata using pdfinfo (if available)
     # Read extraction.json (with NO limit parameter - safety rule)
     # Extract metadata from first 2-3 pages
     # Populate project_metadata object with 8 fields
     # Add extraction_notes['pass0_metadata'] with completion info
     # Write extraction.json (with validation)
     # Print summary with all metadata fields

     4. Add PDF Metadata Cross-Check Function

     File: extraction-system/prompts/00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md (as appendix)

     Purpose: Use pdfinfo command to extract embedded PDF metadata as validation

     Implementation note:
     - Run: pdfinfo "path/to/paper.pdf" | grep -E "Title|Author|Subject|Creator"
     - Use as cross-check against title page extraction
     - If significant mismatch, prefer title page over PDF metadata
     - Document any discrepancies in extraction_notes

     5. Update Validation (Pass 6)

     File: outputs/{slug}/pass6_validation.py

     Changes:
     - Add metadata completeness check
     - Verify all 8 project_metadata fields are non-empty (except doi which can be null)
     - Flag warning if authors are in initial format (e.g., "Ross, S.") instead of full names
     - Add to validation_results['warnings'] if metadata incomplete

     New validation section:
     # Metadata Completeness Validation
     print("7. Metadata Completeness Validation")
     print("-" * 70)

     required_fields = ['paper_title', 'authors', 'publication_year', 'journal', 
                        'paper_type', 'discipline', 'research_context']
     missing_fields = []
     for field in required_fields:
         if field not in data['project_metadata'] or not data['project_metadata'][field]:
             missing_fields.append(field)

     # Check author format (warn if initials detected)
     author_format_warnings = []
     if 'authors' in data['project_metadata']:
         for author in data['project_metadata']['authors']:
             if '.' in author or len(author.split()) < 2:
                 author_format_warnings.append(f"Author may be in initial format: {author}")

     Execution Order

     1. Create prompt file: 00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md
     2. Update WORKFLOW.md documentation
     3. Create template pass0_metadata_extraction.py (for reference)
     4. Update Pass 6 validation script to check metadata completeness
     5. Test on next paper extraction (or re-extract ross-et-al-2009 to fix metadata)

     Benefits

     - Prevents authorship errors like the Ross et al. 2009 incident (wrong authors, wrong journal)
     - Systematic capture ensures every extraction has complete metadata
     - Automated validation catches missing or malformed metadata in Pass 6
     - No manual steps maintains fully autonomous workflow
     - Uses existing schema no breaking changes to extraction.json structure

     Files to Create/Modify

     1. NEW: extraction-system/prompts/00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md (~150-200 lines)
     2. MODIFY: input/WORKFLOW.md (add Pass 0 section, update numbering)
     3. MODIFY: Validation scripts to add metadata completeness checks
     4. TEMPLATE: Reference pass0_metadata_extraction.py (optional, for documentation)

     Risk Assessment

     - Low risk: Uses existing project_metadata schema (no schema changes)
     - Low risk: Adds step before Pass 1 (no impact on existing passes)
     - Medium complexity: Requires careful prompt engineering to extract from varied title page formats
     - High value: Prevents critical bibliographic errors that undermine extraction credibility

     # Pass 0: Metadata Extraction Prompt
     ## Objective
     Extract accurate bibliographic metadata from the first 2-3 pages of the research paper to populate the
     `project_metadata` object in extraction.json. This metadata provides essential context for the extraction
     and ensures proper citation and attribution.
     ## Critical Rules
     1. **Extract from title page ONLY** - Do not use author mentions from acknowledgements, email addresses,
     or later sections
     2. **Full author names required** - Use complete given names, not initials (e.g., "Shawn A. Ross" not
     "Ross, S.A.")

● Implementation Complete: Pass 0 Metadata Extraction

  I've successfully implemented the Pass 0 metadata extraction system to prevent bibliographic errors like the
  one we found in the Ross et al. 2009 extraction. Here's what was completed:

  1. ✓ Created Pass 0 Metadata Extraction Prompt

  File: extraction-system/prompts/00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md

  Comprehensive 400-line prompt providing:
  - Field-by-field extraction instructions for all 8 metadata fields
  - Critical rules (full author names, exact journal, primary source priority)
  - Validation checks and common pitfalls
  - Examples of correct vs. incorrect extraction
  - Integration with workflow (autonomous, no user confirmation)

  2. ✓ Created/Updated WORKFLOW.md

  File: input/WORKFLOW.md (NEW FILE - didn't exist before)

  Complete workflow documentation including:
  - 7-pass extraction process (added Pass 0 before existing 6 passes)
  - Detailed Pass 0 documentation (purpose, inputs, outputs, validation)
  - File safety rules, autonomous execution mode
  - Quality metrics and troubleshooting guidance
  - Version history tracking

  3. ✓ Created Pass 0 Script Template

  File: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/pass0_metadata_extraction.py

  Reference implementation demonstrating:
  - PDF metadata cross-check using pdfinfo
  - Full file read (safety rule compliance)
  - 8-field metadata extraction structure
  - Comprehensive validation logic
  - Integration with extraction_notes

  4. ✓ Updated Pass 6 Validation

  File: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/pass6_validation.py

  Added Section 6: Metadata Completeness Validation checking:
  - All 7 required fields present and non-empty
  - Authors in array format with at least one author
  - publication_year is integer in reasonable range (1900-2030)
  - Journal includes volume/pages indicators
  - research_context is substantive (10+ words)
  - Flags initials in author names as warnings

  5. ✓ Fixed Ross et al. 2009 Metadata

  Before:
  {
    "authors": ["Ross, S.", "Lozny, L.", "Lim, S.", "Cline, E."],
    "journal": "Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry"
  }

  After:
  {
    "paper_title": "Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy",
    "authors": ["Shawn A. Ross", "Adela Sobotkova", "Gert-Jan Burgers"],
    "publication_year": 2009,
    "journal": "Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 34, No. 4 (Winter, 2009), pp. 423-437",
    "doi": null,
    "paper_type": "methods paper",
    "discipline": "archaeology",
    "research_context": "..."
  }

  Validation Status

  ✓ Pass 6 validation: PASS (with 5 acceptable warnings)
  - 4 warnings: Methods without child protocols (expected for conceptual methods)
  - 1 warning: Middle initial "A." detected (acceptable, not an error)

  Benefits Achieved

  1. Prevents authorship errors - Systematic extraction from title page only
  2. No manual steps - Fully autonomous, maintains workflow efficiency
  3. Comprehensive validation - Pass 6 now catches missing/incomplete metadata
  4. Uses existing schema - No breaking changes to extraction.json structure
  5. Well-documented - Complete workflow documentation now available

  Files Created/Modified

  1. NEW: extraction-system/prompts/00-metadata_pass0_prompt.md (400 lines)
  2. NEW: input/WORKFLOW.md (600 lines)
  3. NEW: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/pass0_metadata_extraction.py (170 lines)
  4. MODIFIED: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/pass6_validation.py (added 85-line Section 6)
  5. FIXED: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/extraction.json (corrected project_metadata)
  6. FIXED: outputs/ross-et-al-2009/summary.md (corrected paper details)

  Next Steps for Future Extractions

  For all future paper extractions, the workflow now includes:
  1. Pre-Flight: Initialise extraction environment
  2. Pass 0: Extract metadata from title page ← NEW
  3. Pass 1-5: Content extraction and rationalization
  4. Pass 6: Validation including metadata completeness ← ENHANCED

  The system will automatically catch missing or incorrect metadata in Pass 6 validation before the extraction
  is marked complete.

> ok, great - could you also run a quick check for me (sample is fine, not comprehensive) comparing the 
granularity of claims-evidence items in this pass with that in, say, two of the previous passes? This latest 
pass extracted more items and I'd like a spot check to indicate whether in future we need to adjust 
aggressiveness of 'liberal over-extraction'.

  Granularity Assessment

  Ross et al. 2009 - Appropriate Granularity ✓

  Evidence samples:
  - E001: "100 square kilometres analyzed" - Distinct measurement
  - E002: "29 sites discovered in 4 weeks" - Distinct result
  - E034: "14m RMSE before georeferencing" - Distinct precision metric
  - E035: "3m RMSE after georeferencing" - Distinct improved metric

  Claims samples:
  - C001: "Remote sensing allows efficient evaluation" - Distinct methodological assertion
  - C003: "Can discover significant numbers of sites" - Distinct effectiveness claim
  - C006: "Features reflect geological conditions" - Distinct interpretive insight
  - C035: "Settlement exploits resource zones" - Distinct locational interpretation

  Assessment: Items are well-differentiated. Each claim makes a unique assertion; each evidence item reports a
  distinct measurement or observation. No obvious over-splitting detected.

  ---
  Eftimoski et al. 2017 - Similar Granularity

  Evidence samples:
  - E007: "Erosion rates 0.17-0.22 mm/year" - Distinct measurement
  - E009: "<10m to >50m diameter mounds" - Distinct size range
  - E010: "Contents vary from cenotaphs to elaborate tombs" - Distinct typological observation

  Claims samples:
  - C006: "Approach allows predicting vulnerability" - Distinct methodological claim
  - C009: "Agriculture not wholly benign" - Distinct interpretive claim
  - C010: "Depopulation can threaten heritage" - Distinct finding

  Assessment: Similar granularity to Ross extraction. Items are distinct and appropriately specific. 12.9 
  items/page is comparable to Ross's 15.4 items/page.

  ---
  Sobotkova et al. 2024 - Significantly Sparser

  Evidence samples:
  - E010: "Mounds 10-100m diameter, <1-20m height" - Distinct measurement
  - E011: "57 of 257 excavations were mounds in 2008" - Distinct statistic
  - E014: "F1 score of 0.87" - Distinct performance metric

  Claims samples:
  - C008: "Manual intervention raises efficiency question" - Distinct methodological concern
  - C010: "ML approaches approaching 'crossing the chasm'" - Distinct adoption claim
  - C012: "ML can be labour-intensive" - Distinct resource observation

  Assessment: Items are appropriately granular and distinct, BUT only 2.2 items/page suggests significant 
  under-extraction. The 23-page paper with only 51 total items is unusually sparse compared to Ross (16 pages,
  247 items) and Eftimoski (10 pages, 129 items).

  ---
  Comparison Verdict

  Ross et al. 2009 extraction granularity: APPROPRIATE ✓

  1. Not over-split: Each claim/evidence item represents a distinct assertion or measurement
  2. Consistent with eftimoski-et-al-2017: Both technical archaeology papers show 13-15 items/page
  3. Well-differentiated: Sampling reveals no redundant or overly-granular splitting

  sobotkova-et-al-2024 appears UNDER-extracted ⚠

  - Only 2.2 items/page vs. 13-15 items/page for comparable technical papers
  - 4.4 MB file (similar to Ross's 4.3 MB) but extracted only 51 items vs. 247
  - 23 pages (longer than Ross's 16) but extracted 5× fewer items

  Recommendation

  No adjustment needed to "liberal over-extraction" approach.

  The current extraction aggressiveness for ross-et-al-2009 is appropriate and consistent with
  eftimoski-et-al-2017. The apparent discrepancy is explained by sobotkova-et-al-2024 being under-extracted,
  not ross-et-al-2009 being over-extracted.

  Suggested action: Consider re-extracting sobotkova-et-al-2024 with more aggressive Pass 1 approach to capture
   missing claims and evidence. The current 2.2 items/page density is anomalously low for a 23-page technical
  paper.

> great, thank you. Could you mark sobotkova-et-al-2024 for re-extraction in queue.yaml? I also see that the 
output directory is missing all of the generated execution scripts and other prelimary artefacts. Something 
must have gone wrong!

● Summary: sobotkova-et-al-2024 Marked for Re-extraction

  I've updated queue.yaml to mark sobotkova-et-al-2024 for re-extraction with documentation of both issues:

  Issue 1: Anomalously Sparse Extraction

  Current density: 3.7 items/page (85 items across 23 pages)
  - Claims + Evidence only: 2.2 items/page (51 items)

  Expected density for technical papers: 13-15 items/page
  - ross-et-al-2009: 15.4 items/page (247 items across 16 pages)
  - eftimoski-et-al-2017: 12.9 items/page (129 items across 10 pages)

  Assessment: Significant under-extraction during Pass 1, likely indicating insufficient liberal
  over-extraction phase.

  Issue 2: Missing Execution Artifacts

  sobotkova-et-al-2024: 0 python scripts ❌
  - Only extraction.json and EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md present

  All other completed extractions have scripts: ✓
  - sobotkova-et-al-2023: 12 scripts
  - sobotkova-et-al-2021: 10 scripts
  - eftimoski-et-al-2017: 12 scripts
  - ross-et-al-2009: 13 scripts

  Normal script complement includes:
  - pass0_metadata_extraction.py (if using new workflow)
  - pass1_section{N}_{description}.py (4-8 files)
  - pass2_rationalization.py
  - pass3_rdmap_extraction.py
  - pass4_implicit_rdmap.py
  - pass5_rdmap_rationalization.py
  - pass6_validation.py
  - pass6_repair_references.py (if needed)

  Recommendation for Re-extraction

  When re-extracting sobotkova-et-al-2024:

  1. More aggressive Pass 1: Emphasise the "liberal over-extraction" guidance even more strongly
  2. Target: Aim for 200-300 total items (claims + evidence) for a 23-page technical paper
  3. Preserve scripts: Ensure all pass*.py scripts are retained for documentation/reproducibility
  4. Compare: After Pass 1, compare density with ross-et-al-2009 and eftimoski-et-al-2017 before proceeding to
  Pass 2

  The missing scripts issue suggests the extraction may have been done differently (perhaps manually or through
   a different workflow), which could explain both the missing artifacts and the sparse extraction.

> Thank you. Finally, over the past few extractions, when I've asked you to make and correct your plan for 
extraction, I've used variations of the following three prompts (initial request and two follow-ups to refine 
your plan). Could you help me craft these into an optimal 'priming' prompt to initiate your planning process to
 set up an extraction run? You can save it to extracton-system/staging/\
\
> Please look at input/queue.yaml to determine the next paper for extraction, and WORKFLOW.md to review the 
extraction 
workflow, then develop a detailed plan to extract the next paper. *Do not forget to invoke the 
research-assessor
 skill and keep it invoked throughout the extraction process*, it is crucial for success.
 
> Two corrections / clarifications: For Pass 3: RDMAP Explicit Extraction (Section-by-Section), be sure to (a) 
use the same Likely section groups as claims-evidence extraction, applying the chunking strategy specified in 
the pass1 and pass3 propts, and (b) pay equal attention to the entire paper, do not over-focus on the methods 
section; doing so leads to underextracton of research design and implicit RDMAP items, and other excraction 
shortfalls. For both Pass 1 and Pass 3, please explicitly state the section-by-section approach and recognise 
the chunking strategy.

> One more clarification, we may be experiencing a slight 
under-extraction of RDMAP items (particularly research design elements): For Pass 3: RDMAP Explicit Extraction 
(Section-by-Section), be sure to explicitly mirror the liberal over-extraction approach of Pass 1, including an
 
instruction like: 'Approach: Liberal extraction, cast wide net, aim for over extraction, items will be 
consolidated in the next pass' or similar. For bot Pass 1 and Pass 3, liberal over-extraction with 
consolidation on the subsequent pass (Pass 2 and Pass 4 respectively) should be explicit.

     … +138 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I've created an optimized extraction planning prompt that consolidates your three prompts with improvements.
  Here's what it includes:

  Key Components Integrated

  From Your Initial Prompt:

  - ✓ Check input/queue.yaml for next paper
  - ✓ Review WORKFLOW.md for extraction process
  - ✓ Critical emphasis: Invoke research-assessor skill and keep it invoked throughout (highlighted
  prominently)

  From Your First Clarification:

  - ✓ SAME section groups for Pass 1 and Pass 3 (emphasized multiple times)
  - ✓ Chunking strategy (1500 words, natural boundaries)
  - ✓ EQUAL attention to entire paper, don't over-focus on Methods
  - ✓ Explicit section-by-section approach for both passes

  From Your Second Clarification:

  - ✓ Liberal over-extraction for both Pass 1 and Pass 3
  - ✓ Explicit "cast wide net, aim for over-extraction" language
  - ✓ ESPECIALLY liberal with research designs (called out specifically)
  - ✓ Clear statement that consolidation happens in Pass 2 and Pass 5
  - ✓ Target numbers (40-50% over final expected counts)

  Enhancements Added

  1. Structured Format: Clear sections with hierarchy
  2. Example Plan Template: Shows expected output format with section groups, approach statements, target
  counts
  3. Common Pitfalls Section: Lists 6 specific mistakes to avoid (including forgetting research-assessor skill,
   different section groups, over-focusing on methods)
  4. Target Numbers: Specific extraction targets (60-100 claims, 4-8 designs, etc.)
  5. Usage Notes: Context for when and how to use the prompt
  6. Version History: Tracking for future updates

  File Location

  extraction-system/staging/extraction-planning-prompt.md

  Suggested Usage

  When starting a new extraction, copy the main prompt section and paste it to initiate planning. The example
  template shows you exactly what kind of plan structure to expect in response, making it easier to verify the
  plan includes all required elements (same section groups, liberal approach statements, research-assessor
  skill invocation, etc.).

  The prompt is now comprehensive enough that it should consistently produce well-structured extraction plans
  without requiring follow-up clarifications about section groups, liberal extraction, or equal attention to
  all sections.
