● I'll continue with Pass 10 (Final credibility report) and then update the
  queue.

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/10-final-report-prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 473 lines

● Now let me read the extraction.json for paper metadata and the report
  template:

● Read(outputs/variability-test/ross-2005/run-05/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 725 lines

● Read(assessment-system/templates/credibility-assessment-report-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 201 lines

● Now I have all the information needed. Let me calculate the aggregate
  score and generate the final credibility report.

  Signal scores:
  - Comprehensibility: 75
  - Transparency: 55
  - Plausibility: 78
  - Validity: 72
  - Robustness: 50
  - Generalisability: 70
  - Reproducibility: 55

  Aggregate: (75 + 55 + 78 + 72 + 50 + 70 + 55) / 7 = 455 / 7 = 65 (Good)

  Era context: 2005 = Pre-reproducibility (before 2015)
