● I'll continue with Pass 3-5: RDMAP extraction. Let me first read the
  current extraction.json and the source paper to extract research designs,
  methods, and protocols.

● Read(outputs/variability-test/sobotkova-et-al-2016/run-05/extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 1208 lines

● Read(input/sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2016.md)
  ⎿  Read 253 lines

● Now I'll extract the RDMAP (Research Designs, Methods, Protocols) from
  this methodological paper. This paper is about software co-development
  rather than primary archaeological fieldwork, so the research design is
  reflective/evaluative case study rather than experimental or
  observational.

  7. Key Conclusions

  1. Assessment scores are stable - The credibility assessment system
  produces consistent results (±2-3 points) despite extraction variability
  2. Extraction granularity varies - The same paper can yield 22-50 claims
  or 26-47 evidence items depending on how the extractor segments content
  3. Implicit arguments are robust - These high-level unstated assumptions
  are identified consistently regardless of extraction granularity
  4. RDMAP is most variable - Methods/protocols counts vary significantly
  (0-39), suggesting this component is most sensitive to interpretation
  5. Paper type matters - Empirical papers with clear methods sections show
  lower variability than interpretive or methodological papers
  6. Verdicts are consistent - Despite count variability, the overall
  credibility verdict (GOOD/MODERATE) was stable for each paper

  Variability Patterns by RDMAP Level

  | Level            | Avg CV% | Interpretation
    |
  |------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------
  --|
  | Research Designs | 17%     | Most stable - high-level "why" questions
    |
  | Methods          | 24%     | Moderate - "what" procedures
    |
  | Protocols        | 58%     | Highest variability - granular "how"
  details |

  ---
  Why Protocols Are Most Variable

  The protocol level shows extreme variability (CV up to 122%) because:

  1. Granularity decisions - One run might extract "DNA extraction protocol"
   as a single item; another might split it into "sample preparation",
  "extraction", "purification", "quantification"
  2. Explicit vs implicit - Some runs extract only explicitly described
  protocols; others infer protocols from methods descriptions
  3. Boundary ambiguity - Where does a "method" end and a "protocol" begin?
  This is interpretive
  4. Paper type effects - Interpretive papers (ross-2005) have few/no
  protocols; empirical lab papers (penske-et-al-2023) have many

  | sobotkova-et-al-2016 | 1 : 1.4 : 2.2   | Moderate protocol detail     |

  ---
  Key Findings

  1. Hierarchical stability decreases with granularity
    - Research Designs: Very stable (CV ~17%)
    - Methods: Moderately stable (CV ~24%)
    - Protocols: Highly variable (CV ~58%)
  2. Paper type predicts RDMAP structure
    - Lab-based empirical: Many protocols (penske: avg 27)
    - Methodological: Moderate protocols (ballsun-stanton: avg 7)
    - Interpretive: Few/no protocols (ross: avg 0.8)
  3. Total RDMAP count varies less than components
    - Components trade off against each other
    - One run might have more methods, fewer protocols
    - Total RDMAP stays more consistent (CV 15-38%)
  4. Run-05 of sobotkova-et-al-2016 is an outlier
    - Only 1 research design vs 5-6 in other runs
    - This was my extraction - I took a more consolidated approach to the
  reflective case study design

> Ok, can you tell me what went wrong with sobotkova-et-al-2024? 

● Good catch - Paper 1 has no RDMAP data in the queue. Let me check the
  actual extraction files:

● Bash(for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
        f="outputs/variability-test/sobotkova-et-al-2024/run-0${i}/extraction.js
      on"…)
  ⎿  === Run 1 ===                 
     {
       "research_designs": 3,
     … +27 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The RDMAP data exists - it just wasn't recorded in the queue file! And
  look at this:

  sobotkova-et-al-2024: Perfect RDMAP Consistency

  | Component        | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Run 4 | Run 5 | Variance |
  |------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
  | Research Designs | 3     | 3     | 3     | 3     | 3     | 0        |
  | Methods          | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 0        |
  | Protocols        | 5     | 5     | 5     | 5     | 5     | 0        |
  | Total            | 12    | 12    | 12    | 12    | 12    | 0        |

  This is the most stable RDMAP extraction of any paper - zero variance 
  across all 5 runs!

  ---
  Why Was It Missing From the Queue?

  Paper 1 was the first paper processed in the variability test. The queue
  format evolved during the test - early runs recorded only:
  counts: {evidence: 17, claims: 16, implicit_arguments: 5}

  Later runs added RDMAP and cluster ratings:
  counts: {evidence: 67, claims: 60, implicit_arguments: 10,
  research_designs: 4, methods: 19, protocols: 39}
  cluster_ratings: {c1_foundational_clarity: strong, ...}

  The extraction files have the full data - the queue just wasn't updated
  retroactively.

  Why Is Paper 1 So Stable?

  Looking at the paper characteristics:

  1. Clear empirical structure - Deductive hypothesis-testing paper with
  explicit methods section
  2. Well-defined procedures - Field survey with specific sampling protocols
  3. Minimal interpretive ambiguity - Methods are stated, not inferred
  4. Bounded scope - Single validation study, not a multi-project case study

  This suggests that papers with explicit, well-structured methods sections 
  produce more consistent RDMAP extractions - which is exactly what we'd
  hope for in an assessment system.

  Should I Update the Queue File?

  I can backfill the RDMAP counts for Paper 1 if you'd like to have complete
   data in the queue for future analysis.

> I think we should re-run paper 1 using the protocol we developed for paper
 2 forward, where we clear context each time. Can you reset the queue to 
prepare for that?

  Queue Status

  Paper 1: sobotkova-et-al-2024    5 pending (re-run)
  Paper 2: penske-et-al-2023       5 completed
  Paper 3: ballsun-stanton-2018    5 completed
  Paper 4: ross-2005               5 completed
  Paper 5: sobotkova-et-al-2016    5 completed

  To Start Re-runs

  1. Run /clear to reset context
  2. Run /variability-run to execute run-01
  3. Repeat for each of the 5 runs

  This will let us compare:
  - Original runs (without context clearing) - archived with previous_*
  fields
  - New runs (with context clearing) - following Paper 2+ protocol

  We can then see if the zero-variance RDMAP result was an artefact of
  shared context or a genuine property of well-structured empirical papers.

> can you archive the old run like you did with the other runs we re-did?

  Note: There's also outputs/variability-test/sobotkova-et-al-2024-pre-fix/
  which appears to be an even older version - want me to move that to the
  archive as well?

> perfect, one other thing I want to note for future action but defer for 
now:   2. Explicit vs implicit - Some runs extract only explicitly described
 protocols; others infer protocols from methods
  descriptions\
I want to articulate and standardise explicit vs. implicit in the prompts / 
skill - I'm not sure which yet, but I don't want this varying from one run 
to the next. Can you note that down in our current to-do / working document 
for later action?

       763 +  ### 8b. Protocol Extraction: Explicit vs Implicit 
           + Standardisation
       764 +  
       765 +  **Priority:** MEDIUM
       766 +  **Status:** PENDING - Identified from variability test 
           + analysis
       767 +  **Added:** 2025-12-04
       768 +  
       769 +  **Issue:**
       770 +  Variability analysis revealed that protocol extraction 
           + varies significantly between runs (CV up to 122% for 
           + ross-2005, 46% for sobotkova-et-al-2016). A key source of 
           + this variability is inconsistent handling of explicit vs 
           + implicit protocols:
       771 +  
       772 +  - **Some runs extract only explicitly described protocols**
           +  - procedures stated directly in the paper
       773 +  - **Other runs infer protocols from methods descriptions** 
           + - procedures implied by methodology but not spelled out
       774 +  
       775 +  This is a source of extraction inconsistency that should be
           +  standardised.
       776 +  
       777 +  **Decision Needed:**
       778 +  1. **Explicit-only approach**: Extract only protocols 
           + explicitly described in the paper text
       779 +     - Pro: Higher consistency, lower false positives
       780 +     - Con: May miss important procedural details implied but
           +  not stated
       781 +  
       782 +  2. **Explicit + implicit approach**: Extract both stated 
           + and inferred protocols
       783 +     - Pro: More complete procedural capture
       784 +     - Con: Higher variability, requires clear inference 
           + rules
       785 +  
       786 +  3. **Tiered approach**: Extract explicit protocols, flag 
           + implicit protocols separately
       787 +     - Pro: Captures both while maintaining transparency
       788 +     - Con: More complex schema/workflow
       789 +  
       790 +  **Action Required:**
       791 +  - [ ] Review protocol extraction guidance in Pass 3-5 
           + prompts
       792 +  - [ ] Decide on standardised approach (explicit-only, 
           + explicit+implicit, or tiered)
       793 +  - [ ] Update prompts/skill to enforce consistent approach
       794 +  - [ ] Add examples distinguishing explicit from implicit 
           + protocols
       795 +  - [ ] Test on 2-3 papers to verify reduced variability
       796 +  
       797 +  **Files to Update:**
       798 +  - `extraction-system/prompts/03-rdmap_pass1a_explicit_promp
           + t.md`
       799 +  - `extraction-system/prompts/04-rdmap_pass1b_implicit_promp
           + t.md`
       800 +  - `.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/checklists/`
           +  (add protocol guidance)
       801 +  
       802 +  **When:** After Paper 1 re-run complete (to establish 
           + baseline variability with current approach)

           + methodological consistency across all papers. Original runs

● Done. Added Section 8b: Protocol Extraction: Explicit vs Implicit 
  Standardisation to the active to-do list with:

  - Issue description from variability analysis
  - Three options for standardisation (explicit-only, explicit+implicit,
  tiered)
  - Action items checklist
  - Files to update
  - Timing: after Paper 1 re-run to establish baseline

  Also updated Section 8a to reflect Paper 1 reset status and overall test
  progress (20/25 complete).
