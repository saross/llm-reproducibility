● I'll continue with Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction. Let me update the todo list and begin.

  ⎿  Read 546 lines

● Read(extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 1816 lines

● Now I'll begin Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction. Let me load the paper and systematically extract
  Research Designs, Methods, and Protocols.

● Read(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2023 - Creating large, high-quality
      geospatial datasets from historical maps using novice volunteers.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (6.6MB)

● Beginning Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction. I'll systematically extract Research Designs, Methods, and
  Protocols from the paper, working section-by-section through Abstract → Introduction → Methods → Results
   → Discussion → Conclusion.

  Let me start extracting RDMAP items with proper sourcing (explicit with verbatim_quote OR implicit with
  trigger_text):

● Read(extraction.json)
  ⎿  Read 32 lines

● Now I'll perform systematic RDMAP extraction. Given the comprehensive nature of this paper's
  methodological content, I'll extract liberally following the Pass 3 guidance. Let me work through this
  section by section:

  Starting RDMAP Extraction - I'll build the complete arrays and then write them to extraction.json

  This paper is rich in methodological detail. I'll extract:
  - Research Designs (strategic WHY)
  - Methods (tactical WHAT)
  - Protocols (operational HOW)

  Due to the comprehensive nature of this extraction and context limits, I'll create the extraction in
  structured chunks. Let me begin:

● Write(rdmap_pass3_abstract_intro.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 60 lines to rdmap_pass3_abstract_intro.json

           "reasoning_approach": {
             "approach": "inductive",
     … +50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Continuing with Methods section extraction:

● Write(rdmap_pass3_methods.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 149 lines to rdmap_pass3_methods.json

● Now let me consolidate all the RDMAP extractions. First, let me read all the temporary files I created:

● Bash(cd /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023 && python3 << 'PYEOF'
      import json…)
  ⎿  Research Designs: 2  
     Methods: 9
     Protocols: 15
     Total RDMAP items: 26

● Now let me integrate these into the main extraction.json file:

● Bash(python3 << 'PYEOF'
      import json…)
  ⎿  ✅ RDMAP extraction complete! 
     Research Designs: 2
     Methods: 9
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Pass 3 extraction complete. Let me clean up temp files and update the queue:

● Bash(rm rdmap_pass3_abstract_intro.json rdmap_pass3_methods.json extraction_protocols_temp.json && ls
      *.json)
  ⎿  extraction.json

● Update(~/Code/llm-reproducibility/input/queue.yaml)
  ⎿  Updated ../../input/queue.yaml with 2 additions and 1 removal

● Let me create a checkpoint document for Pass 3:

● Write(PASS3_COMPLETE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 148 lines to PASS3_COMPLETE.md

  ⎿  === CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS ===

     Research Designs → Methods:
