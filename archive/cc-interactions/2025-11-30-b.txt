> /compact   Session context: Report template design for credibility assessment 
system.

  Decisions made:
  1. Structured output format: JSON (not YAML) - stricter parsing, jq friendly, 
JSON→YAML lossless conversion
  2. Report is prose markdown (human-readable) + JSON block (machine-parseable)
  3. Report sections: Executive summary, Classification summary, Signal scores 
dashboard, Detailed findings (per-cluster), Infrastructure/FAIR summary,
  Contextual interpretation, JSON structured output

  Current state:
  - Individual cluster outputs exist (classification.md, track-a-quality.md, 
cluster-1/2/3-*.md)
  - No unified final report template
  - No contextual interpretation layer yet

  Next session task: Create final report template 
(credibility-assessment-report-template.md) that consolidates cluster outputs 
into single report with
  contextual interpretation.

  Reference files:
  - Existing outputs: outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/
  - Cluster prompts: assessment-system/prompts/cluster-*.md

  Pending todos:
  - [REPORT DESIGN] Add contextual interpretation for scores
  - [REPORT DESIGN] Include paper-type contextual notes
  - [REPORT DESIGN] Flag paper-type score variations

> Hi CC, welcome back, can you please take our investigation / preliminary 
work from the previous session and create the formal plan to build a  
unified final report template with contextual interpretation layer? 

● I'll create a formal plan for the unified final report template. Let me
  first read the existing plan file and explore the current assessment
  infrastructure.

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md)
  ⎿  Read 201 lines

● Search(pattern: "outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "assessment-system/prompts/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me read the existing assessment outputs and cluster prompts to
  understand the current structure:

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/classification.md)
  ⎿  Read 96 lines

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/track-a-quality.md)
  ⎿  Read 118 lines

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-1-foundational-clari
      ty.md)
  ⎿  Read 168 lines

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-2-evidential-strengt
      h.md)
  ⎿  Read 269 lines

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-3-reproducibility.md
      )
  ⎿  Read 213 lines

● Let me also read the old assessment report and one of the cluster prompts
  to understand the expected format:

● Read(outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/assessment-report.md)
  ⎿  Read 377 lines

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md)
  ⎿  Read 538 lines

● I now have a complete picture of the current assessment system. Let me
  create the plan for the unified final report template. I'll overwrite the
  old housekeeping plan with the new plan.

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● I've created a comprehensive plan for the unified final report template.
  The plan covers:

  Deliverables:
  1. Report template
  (assessment-system/templates/credibility-assessment-report-template.md)
  2. Final Report prompt (Pass 10 — 10-final-report-prompt.md)
  3. JSON schema for machine-readable output

  Report sections:
  1. Executive Summary (< 200 words)
  2. Classification Summary
  3. Signal Scores Dashboard (7 signals + context flags)
  4. Detailed Findings (per-cluster)
  5. Infrastructure & FAIR Summary
  6. Contextual Interpretation (the key value-add — explains what scores
  mean for THIS paper type)
  7. Structured JSON Output

  Before I finalize the plan, I have a few questions:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What terminology should we use for the overall credibility verdict? →
      We may need to discuss this; is a three-tier division optimal? Should 
     we use a (say) five-step Likert scale? What are your thoughts?
     · Should we compute a single aggregate credibility score (0-100) in 
     addition to the verdict bands? → Yes, but flag 'experimental' and 
     contexualise that we're investigating what this might mean, and whether
      to retain it.
     · Should the report include historical context interpretation based on 
     publication year? → Yes, include era context


● Good questions! Let me think through the verdict scale options:

  Current signal bands (5-tier):
  - Excellent (80-100)
  - Good (60-79)
  - Moderate (40-59)
  - Low (20-39)
  - Minimal (0-19)

  Options for overall verdict:

  Option A: 3-tier (as proposed)
  - Strong / Adequate / Weak
  - Pros: Simple, easy to communicate, less false precision
  - Cons: May bunch too many papers in middle tier

  Option B: 5-tier aligned with signal bands
  - Excellent / Good / Moderate / Low / Minimal (or equivalent)
  - Pros: Consistent with signal scoring, more granular
  - Cons: More complex, harder to define aggregation rules

  Option C: 5-tier with verdict-specific language
  - Very Strong / Strong / Adequate / Weak / Very Weak
  - Pros: Distinct from signal language, graded credibility
  - Cons: Need to define mapping from signal scores

  My recommendation is 5-tier aligned because:
  1. It matches the signal bands you already have
  2. More nuance for batch analysis
  3. Aggregate score (which we're including experimentally) will naturally
  map to bands
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which verdict scale should we use for the overall credibility 
     assessment? → I think we can start with the 5-tier aligned and see how 
     it works. Note that for FAIR/open-research compliance, I'm undertaking 
     some research with Opus in the chatbot to utilise existing 'maturity' 
     frameworks; the initial example we have is four-tier - we may later 
     need to split FAIR/OS infrastructure, but we can save that for later.



● Excellent! All decisions are now clear. Let me update the plan with the
  confirmed choices:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Let me also update the verdict determination logic and JSON example to
  reflect the 5-tier decision:

     Unified Credibility Assessment Report Template Plan

     Date: 2025-11-30
     Purpose: Design a final report template that consolidates individual 
     cluster outputs into a unified credibility assessment report with 
     contextual interpretation
     Scope: Template + prompt for Pass 10 (Final Report Generation)

     ---
     Background: Current State

     Existing Assessment Outputs

     Individual assessment outputs (currently generated in Passes 8-9):

     assessment/
     ├── classification.md          # Paper type, approach, framework
     ├── track-a-quality.md         # Quality gating (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
     ├── cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md   # Signals 1-2
     ├── cluster-2-evidential-strength.md    # Signals 3-6
     ├── cluster-3-reproducibility.md        # Signal 7
     └── assessment-report.md       # OLD format (extraction quality)

     What's Missing

     1. Unified final report — No single document consolidates all cluster 
     findings
     2. Contextual interpretation — What scores mean for THIS paper 
     (paper-type-specific)
     3. Machine-readable aggregate — No single JSON block with all scores
     4. Executive summary — No concise overview for quick assessment
     5. Paper-type variance flags — No indication of where scores are 
     expected to differ

     Key Decisions (from previous session)

     1. Format: JSON for structured output (not YAML) — stricter parsing, 
     jq-friendly
     2. Structure: Prose markdown (human-readable) + JSON block 
     (machine-parseable)
     3. Sections: Executive summary, Classification summary, Signal scores 
     dashboard, Detailed findings, Infrastructure/FAIR summary, Contextual 
     interpretation, JSON output

     ---
     Deliverables

     1. Final Report Template

     File: 
     assessment-system/templates/credibility-assessment-report-template.md

     A markdown template with placeholders for:
     - Paper metadata
     - Classification summary
     - Signal scores (7 signals) with bands
     - Cluster-by-cluster findings
     - Contextual interpretation notes
     - JSON structured output block

     2. Final Report Prompt (Pass 10)

     File: assessment-system/prompts/10-final-report-prompt.md

     A prompt that:
     - Reads all cluster outputs
     - Synthesises into unified report
     - Adds contextual interpretation layer
     - Generates machine-readable JSON aggregate

     3. JSON Schema for Final Report

     File: assessment-system/schema/credibility-report-schema.json

     JSON schema defining the structured output format for machine 
     processing.

     ---
     Report Structure Design

     Section 1: Executive Summary (< 200 words)

     Purpose: Quick assessment snapshot for busy readers

     Content:
     - Paper identification (title, authors, DOI)
     - Paper type and approach (one line)
     - Overall credibility verdict: Strong / Adequate / Weak / Caveated
     - Key strengths (2-3 bullet points)
     - Key concerns (1-2 bullet points)
     - Bottom line statement (one sentence)

     Example:
     Verdict: Strong (Adequate-to-Strong)

     This methodological advocacy paper demonstrates strong foundational 
     clarity and plausible argument structure. Robustness is Moderate, 
     reflecting the argumentative (vs empirical) nature of the work. Readers
      should independently consider alternative transparency approaches.

     Section 2: Classification Summary

     Purpose: Document paper type and assessment framework used

     Content:
     - Paper type (empirical/methodological/theoretical/meta-research)
     - Research approach (deductive/inductive/abductive)
     - Framework applied (which anchor sets used)
     - Quality state (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW) and implications
     - Key contextual notes (what to expect for this paper type)

     Section 3: Signal Scores Dashboard

     Purpose: At-a-glance score overview

     Format: Table with all 7 signals

     | Signal            | Score | Band      | Cluster | Context Flag       
            |
     |-------------------|-------|-----------|---------|--------------------
     -------|
     | Comprehensibility | 78    | Good      | 1       |                    
            |
     | Transparency      | 75    | Good      | 1       |                    
            |
     | Plausibility      | 80    | Excellent | 2       |                    
            |
     | Validity          | 72    | Good      | 2       |                    
            |
     | Robustness        | 58    | Moderate  | 2       | ⚠️ Expected for 
     advocacy  |
     | Generalisability  | 76    | Good      | 2       |                    
            |
     | Reproducibility   | 72    | Good      | 3       | ⚠️ Methodological 
     variant |

     Context Flag key:
     - ⚠️ = Score expected to differ from typical empirical paper
     - 🔧 = Methodological variant anchors applied
     - 📊 = Aggregate score (multiple sub-scores)

     Section 4: Detailed Findings (Per-Cluster)

     Purpose: Preserve detail from cluster assessments

     Structure: Three subsections (one per cluster)

     For each cluster:
     - Summary (2-3 sentences)
     - Key strengths (from cluster output)
     - Key weaknesses (from cluster output)
     - Implications for credibility

     Section 5: Infrastructure & FAIR Summary

     Purpose: Reproducibility infrastructure assessment

     Content:
     - FAIR score (0-40 scale) and rating
     - Code availability status
     - Data availability status
     - PID coverage (DOIs, ORCIDs)
     - Preregistration status
     - Key infrastructure gaps

     Section 6: Contextual Interpretation

     Purpose: What scores MEAN for THIS paper — the interpretive layer

     This is the key value-add of the unified report.

     Structure:

     For each signal with context flag:
     - Why this score is expected for this paper type
     - How to interpret it (not a weakness, just different)
     - What readers should consider

     Example for Robustness (58):
     Why this score: Methodological advocacy papers argue for a position 
     rather than testing multiple alternatives. A Moderate Robustness score 
     is typical — and not a severe criticism — for this paper type.

     What readers should do: Consider alternative approaches to research 
     transparency (e.g., registered reports, data sharing mandates) 
     independently when evaluating the argument.

     Example for Reproducibility (72, Methodological Variant):
     Why this score: This paper has no computational component — there is no
      analysis to re-run. Reproducibility is assessed using the 
     Methodological Transparency variant, which evaluates reasoning 
     traceability rather than computational reproduction.

     What this means: The score reflects that the argument structure is 
     well-documented and reasoning is traceable. "Reproduction" means 
     following the same argumentative approach, not re-running code.

     Section 7: Structured Output (JSON)

     Purpose: Machine-readable aggregate for batch processing

     Format: JSON block at end of document

     Contextual Interpretation Rules

     Paper Type Context Flags

     Methodological papers:
     - Robustness: ⚠️ "Expected to be Moderate — advocacy papers argue for 
     position, not test alternatives"
     - Reproducibility: 🔧 "Methodological Transparency variant — reasoning 
     traceability, not code re-execution"
     - Evidence counts: "Lower evidence counts expected — argument-based, 
     not data-based"

     Empirical papers:
     - (No special flags — default expectations apply)

     Theoretical papers:
     - Robustness: ⚠️ "Framework evaluation, not empirical replication"
     - Reproducibility: 🔧 "Methodological Transparency variant"

     Approach-Specific Context Flags

     Abductive:
     - Robustness: "Inference to best explanation — alternatives considered 
     but not exhaustively tested"

     Inductive:
     - Transparency: "Pre-registration not expected for exploratory 
     research"

     Deductive:
     - (No special flags — default expectations)

     Score Interpretation Guidelines

     | Band      | Score Range | Interpretation                             
           |
     |-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------
     ------|
     | Excellent | 80-100      | Top quartile — exceeds expectations        
           |
     | Good      | 60-79       | Solid — meets expectations well            
           |
     | Moderate  | 40-59       | Acceptable — meets minimum, room for 
     improvement |
     | Low       | 20-39       | Below expectations — significant concerns  
           |
     | Minimal   | 0-19        | Serious concerns — credibility impaired    
           |

     ---
     Verdict Determination Logic

     5-Tier Verdict (aligned with signal bands):

     | Band      | Score Range | Criteria                                   
                     |
     |-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------
     ----------------|
     | Excellent | 80-100      | All signals ≥ 60; aggregate ≥ 80; no signal
      < 50           |
     | Good      | 60-79       | Most signals ≥ 60; aggregate ≥ 60; at most 
     one signal < 50 |
     | Moderate  | 40-59       | Most signals ≥ 40; aggregate ≥ 40          
                     |
     | Low       | 20-39       | Aggregate 20-39; multiple signals < 40     
                     |
     | Minimal   | 0-19        | Aggregate < 20; majority of signals < 40   
                     |

     Aggregate Score Calculation (EXPERIMENTAL):
     aggregate = (comprehensibility + transparency + plausibility + validity
                + robustness + generalisability + reproducibility) / 7

     Equal weights initially. Future refinement may adjust weights by paper 
     type.

     Caveated Assessment:
     - Quality State = MODERATE → Add caveat banner, report scores as 
     20-point bands
     - Quality State = LOW → Assessment should not proceed (Track A gates 
     this)

     Confidence Level:

     - HIGH: Quality State = HIGH, Classification Confidence = HIGH
     - MEDIUM: Either Quality State or Classification = MODERATE

     Decisions (Confirmed)

     1. Verdict scale: 5-tier aligned with signal bands
       - Excellent (80-100), Good (60-79), Moderate (40-59), Low (20-39), 
     Minimal (0-19)
       - Consistent terminology between signals and overall verdict
     2. Aggregate score: Yes, include but flag as experimental
       - Compute weighted average of 7 signals (equal weights initially)
       - Include note: "Aggregate score is experimental — we are 
     investigating what it means and whether to retain it"
     3. Era context: Yes, include publication year interpretation
       - Pre-2015: "Pre-reproducibility crisis awareness"
       - 2015-2020: "Early adopter era — reproducibility discussions 
     emerging"
       - 2020-present: "Current era — FAIR and open science expectations 
     established"
     4. Precision: Report scores as integers (0-100), ±5 precision implied 
     by quality state
     5. FAIR/OS infrastructure: Note for future
       - Parallel research on maturity frameworks (4-tier) underway
       - May need to split FAIR/OS infrastructure assessment later
       - For now, include in Infrastructure & FAIR Summary section

     Success Criteria

     1. ✅ Single unified report consolidates all cluster outputs
     2. ✅ JSON block is valid and parseable with jq
     3. ✅ Contextual interpretation explains paper-type-specific score 
     meanings
     4. ✅ Executive summary is < 200 words and captures key takeaways
     5. ✅ Template can be applied to any paper (not 
     ross-ballsun-stanton-specific)
     6. ✅ Report is useful for both human readers and batch processing
