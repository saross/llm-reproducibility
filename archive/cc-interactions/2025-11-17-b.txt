● You did answer my questions! I found them in the archive. Let me update
  the todos to reflect the completed work:

● Perfect! I found all your responses in the archived conversation:

  Your answers to my 3 questions:

  1. Q1 (Skill architecture): Extend research-assessor skill (not separate)
  - organic linkage with progressive disclosure
  2. Q2 (RepliCATS access): Full access via colleague, ready for end-to-end
  prototype testing
  3. Q3 (Gold standard): You'll manually assess 3 papers at highest-impact
  time (Phase 4)

  Your key guidance on prompt architecture:
  - Agreed to 6-prompt architecture (down from 10)
  - 500-line threshold is a monitoring point, not a hard ceiling
  - We've been fine with prompts up to 712 lines in extraction workflow
  - Continue seeking external reviews (GPT/Gemini) at key junctures

  All the planning context has been restored! I'm ready to create
  implementation plan v2.0 incorporating:

  - 6-prompt architecture
  - Track A quality gating with 3-state system
  - Approach-specific scoring anchors
  - Test-retest reliability checks
  - Early repliCATS pilot (Phase 1.5)
  - Canonical assessment.json
  - All other accepted improvements from synthesis

  Shall I proceed with creating the revised plan?

     # Credibility Assessment Implementation Plan v2.0
     ## Revised Architecture with Quality Gating, Reliability Checks, and
     6-Prompt Design
     **Document Purpose:** Implementation-ready plan incorporating external
     review feedback and design refinements
     **Date Created:** 2025-11-17
     **Version:** 2.0 (revised from v1.0 based on synthesis of Claude +
     GPT-5.1 feedback + Shawn decisions)
     **Status:** Implementation-ready
     **Prerequisites:** Extraction complete (Pass 0-6), metrics calculated
     (Phase 6)

● Perfect! I've created implementation plan v2.0 incorporating all the
  improvements from the synthesis. Here's what changed from v1.0:

  Major Architectural Changes

  1. 6-Prompt Architecture (down from 10)

  Signals clustered by conceptual coherence:
  - Cluster 1: Comprehensibility + Transparency (foundational clarity)
  - Cluster 2: Plausibility + Validity + Robustness (evidential strength)
  - Cluster 3: Replicability + Generalisability (reproducibility & scope)

  All prompts 300-550 lines (respecting your 500-line monitoring threshold).

  2. Track A Quality Gating (GPT-5.1's strongest critique)

  Three-state system with behavioral rules:
  - HIGH: Full assessment, approach-specific anchors
  - MODERATE: Caveated report, 20-point score bands, warnings
  - LOW: Abort assessment, Track A report only

  3. Approach-Specific Scoring Anchors

  Concrete 0-100 scales for each signal × each approach:
  - Example: Replicability 80-100 for deductive = pre-registration + data +
  code
  - Example: Replicability 80-100 for inductive = workflow documented + data
   archived

  4. Test-Retest Reliability Checks

  Quantitative validation at multiple checkpoints:
  - Run assessments 3× per paper
  - Measure SD (threshold: SD < 10 points)
  - Ensures scoring consistency

  5. Early RepliCATS Pilot (Phase 1.5)

  - After classifier + first cluster working
  - Test on 1-2 repliCATS papers with expert scores
  - Catch structural misalignment before building all rubrics

  6. Canonical assessment.json

  Post-processing consolidation for corpus analysis:
  - All classification + signals + Track A + metrics in one JSON
  - Enables cross-paper statistics with jq

  Other Enhancements

  7. Low-confidence classification handling (triggers moderate quality
  state)
  8. File format standardization (JSON for data, Markdown for narrative)
  9. Defeasible "no expressed method" interpretation (context-sensitive)
  10. Metric-signal soft guidance with divergence monitoring
  11. Experimental system disclaimer in all reports
  12. Cross-signal coherence checking in validation

  Updated Implementation Sequence

  Phase 1 (12-15 hours): Now includes:
  - Step 3.5: Early repliCATS pilot (NEW)
  - Step 4: Track A quality gating (NEW)
  - Enhanced reliability testing throughout

  File created: planning/credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md (44KB,
  comprehensive)

  The plan is now implementation-ready with all consensus improvements from:
  - ✅ Your decisions (extend skill, 6 prompts, repliCATS access, manual
  assessment)
  - ✅ My self-critique (validation, testing, consolidation)
  - ✅ GPT-5.1 external review (quality gating, anchors, reliability)

  Ready to begin Phase 1 when you are!

● Perfect! Here's your compact message summarizing the session. The
  implementation plan v2.0 is complete and ready for Phase 1 execution when
  you are.

  Key takeaway: We've created a robust, well-validated plan incorporating
  all the best ideas from your feedback, my self-critique, and GPT-5.1's
  external review. The 6-prompt architecture with quality gating,
  reliability checks, and approach-specific anchors addresses all major
  concerns while respecting your empirical, iterative philosophy.
