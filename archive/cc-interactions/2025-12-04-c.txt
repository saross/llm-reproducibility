● Now I'll apply Pass 5 RDMAP rationalisation. Let me review the current
  RDMAP items and apply the consolidation principles:

  Current totals:
  - Research Designs: 6 (5 explicit + 1 implicit)
  - Methods: 9 (7 explicit + 2 implicit)
  - Protocols: 14 (9 explicit + 5 implicit)
  - Total: 29 RDMAP items

  Rationalisation analysis:

  Research Designs (6):
  - RD001 (multiple_case_study) and RD002 (thematic_synthesis) - These are
  distinct strategic decisions. RD001 is about the case study approach,
  RD002 is about how findings are organised. Keep separate.
  - RD003 (co-development_partnership_model) - Distinct strategic choice
  about software-archaeologist relationship. Keep.
  - RD004 (generalised_software_approach) - Distinct positioning decision.
  Keep.
  - RD005 (open_source_sustainability_model) - Distinct business/funding
  model decision. Keep.
  - RD-IMP-001 (retrospective_reporting) - Distinct design limitation. Keep.

  No consolidation needed for research designs - each represents an
  independent strategic decision.

  Methods (9):
  - M001 (post-project_questionnaire) and M002 (communication_log_analysis)
  - Both are data collection methods for the case study. Could be
  consolidated as "case study data collection" but they serve different
  analytical purposes. Keep separate.
  - M003 (module_customisation), M004 (requirements_gathering), M005
  (iterative_testing), M006 (version_control_management) - These form a
  workflow but are assessed independently. Keep separate.
  - M007 (cost_benefit_comparison) - Distinct analytical method. Keep.
  - M-IMP-001 (theme_identification) and M-IMP-002 (quote_selection) - Both
  are implicit qualitative analysis methods. Could be consolidated as they
  both relate to how case study data was analysed for presentation.
  Candidate for consolidation - but they address different aspects (pattern
  identification vs exemplar selection). Keep separate for assessment
  granularity.

  No consolidation needed for methods.

  Protocols (14):
  - P001 (data_collection_instrument) - Questionnaire. Keep.
  - P002 (archival_data_procedure) - Communication archiving. Keep.
  - P003 (module_forking_procedure) and P007 (version_control_workflow) -
  Both relate to GitHub workflow. Consolidation candidate. P003 focuses on
  forking, P007 on publishing/pulling. They're aspects of the same version
  control approach but describe different operations.
  - P004 (module_customisation_methods) - Four-level hierarchy. Keep -
  detailed protocol.
  - P005 (requirements_elicitation_procedure) - Workshop process. Keep.
  - P006 (testing_procedure) - Pre-deployment testing. Keep.
  - P008 (server_deployment_options) - Hardware options. Keep.
  - P009 (single_context_recording) - Archaeological method. Keep.
  - P-IMP-001 through P-IMP-005 - All implicit protocols addressing
  different transparency gaps. Keep separate for assessment.

  Decision: P003 and P007 could be consolidated as they both describe
  GitHub-based workflow operations, but they serve different assessment
  purposes (forking is about module adaptation, version control is about
  publishing/sharing). Keep separate for assessment granularity.

  Cross-reference verification:
  - Need to verify all bidirectional references are correct
  - Check design→method→protocol chains

  Tier verification:
  - All designs answer WHY - confirmed
  - All methods answer WHAT - confirmed
  - All protocols answer HOW - confirmed

  Conclusion: No consolidations needed. The extraction is already at
  appropriate granularity. The 27% implicit ratio is within normal range.
  I'll update the extraction.json with Pass 5 notes and verify
  cross-references.
