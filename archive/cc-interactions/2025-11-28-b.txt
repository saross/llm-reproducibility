> Hi CC, welcome back, can you explain the next steps please? 

● Welcome back! Here's where we are in Phase 7:

  Phase 7 Status

  | Step | Description                     | Status     |
  |------|---------------------------------|------------|
  | 1    | Skill reference files           | ✅ Complete |
  | 2    | Classification prompt (Pass 8)  | ✅ Complete |
  | 3    | Classifier testing (1 run each) | ✅ Complete |
  | 4    | Track A quality gating          | ✅ Complete |
  | 5    | Foundational clarity cluster    | ⏳ Next     |
  | 6    | Test foundational clarity       | ⏳ Pending  |
  | 7    | Remaining clusters              | ⏳ Pending  |

  Next Steps (in order)

  Option A - Classifier reliability first:
  - Run Pass 8 classification 2 more times on each of 3 papers (6 runs
  total)
  - Check test-retest reliability (target: SD < 10 points)
  - This validates the classifier before we build more on top of it

  Option B - Continue with Step 5:
  - Create cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md prompt
  - Assesses Comprehensibility + Transparency signals (0-100 scores)
  - Uses approach-specific scoring anchors from classification

  Option C - Both:
  - Do reliability runs, then proceed to Step 5 if context allows

  Last session you decided to defer classifier reliability to "a future
  session." Would you like to:
  1. Complete the 6 classifier reliability runs now
  2. Skip ahead to Step 5 (Foundational Clarity cluster)
  3. Something else

> Ok, great - let's do option A 

● I'll run 2 additional Pass 8 classifications on each of the 3 papers to
  test reliability. Let me set up tracking and begin.

● Now I'll perform the classification for Run 2 of sobotkova-et-al-2024.
  Following the classification prompt, I'll analyse independently:

  Run 2 Classification: sobotkova-et-al-2024

  Analysing the extraction evidence:

  Paper Type (Step 1):
  - Title: "Validating predictions of burial mounds with field data"
  - Primary contribution: Understanding ML effectiveness for archaeological
  prospection
  - Methods (CNN) are tools for investigation, not the subject
  - Claims describe model performance outcomes
  → empirical

  Expressed Approach (Step 3):
  - RD001: "External validation design comparing ML model predictions
  against comprehensive field survey data"
  - RD002: "Comparative two-run design testing impact of training data
  curation"
  - Abstract uses "validate" language
  → deductive (explicit validation/testing framework)

  Revealed Approach (Step 3):
  - Claims report test outcomes: "both models failed to identify burial
  mounds" (C002)
  - Workflow: Prediction → Test against ground truth → Report results
  - Performance metrics (precision, recall, false positive/negative rates)
  → deductive (hypothesis-testing results structure)

  Comparison: Matched - both express and reveal deductive validation

  Mixed elements: Secondary inductive analysis of failure modes, but primary
   structure is validation

     … +75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Run 3 Classification: sobotkova-et-al-2024

  Fresh independent analysis:

  The title "Validating predictions..." immediately signals a
  testing/verification design. Research designs explicitly describe
  validation frameworks (RD001, RD002). The analytical workflow follows
  Prediction → Test → Result, not Pattern → Description → Interpretation.

  While one could argue the failure mode analysis is inductive (exploring
  why the model failed), this is secondary to the primary validation
  structure. The paper's contribution is testing whether ML predictions
  work, not discovering new patterns.

  Independent analysis:

  Paper Type: Methodological - primary contribution is FAIMS Mobile software
   platform. Claims describe software capabilities (C001: "FAIMS Mobile is a
   native Android application", C002: "includes features allowing rich and
  efficient data capture"). The software is the contribution, not a tool
  used to study something else.

  Validation Approach: Inductive/descriptive - capabilities demonstrated
  through case studies referenced from Sobotkova et al. 2016, no
  hypothesis-testing of performance.

  Fresh analysis considering potential alternatives:

  Could this be empirical? No - the software is the contribution, not a tool
   used to study phenomena. The case studies validate the tool, they don't
  represent the primary research contribution.

  Could validation be deductive? No - no hypothesis-testing, no benchmarking
   against predictions. Validation is descriptive demonstration.

  Paper Type: Empirical - analyses genome-wide data from 135 ancient
  individuals to investigate population dynamics. DNA extraction and genetic
   analysis methods are tools for investigating phenomena (prehistoric
  contact), not the subject.

  Expressed Approach: Deductive - RD007 explicitly tests pathogen hypothesis
   ("Systematic pathogen screening to test disease hypotheses for CA
  abandonment"). Uses statistical hypothesis testing throughout.

  Revealed Approach: Deductive - f4-symmetry statistics and qpAdm models are
   hypothesis-testing methods. Claims report test outcomes.

  Could this be inductive? No - while it characterizes previously
  undocumented genetic diversity, the primary structure is testing
  hypotheses (pathogen hypothesis, ancestry models) against data. The
  characterization serves hypothesis testing.

  Could this be abductive? No - claims report test outcomes
  (confirmation/rejection), not inference to best explanation.

> can you remind me what the clarity cluster prompt does? 

● Foundational Clarity Cluster (Cluster 1)

  Purpose: Assess the two "foundation" signals that underpin all other
  credibility assessment:

  Signal 1: Comprehensibility (0-100)

  Can readers understand what was done and found?

  - Clarity of research questions and objectives
  - Logical flow of argument
  - Accessibility of methods descriptions
  - Clear presentation of results
  - Coherent interpretation

  Signal 2: Transparency (0-100)

  Is the research process openly documented?

  - Research design explicitly stated
  - Methods sufficiently detailed for evaluation
  - Data sources and collection described
  - Analytical decisions documented
  - Limitations acknowledged

  ---
  Why "foundational"?

  These signals are prerequisites - you can't properly assess validity,
  robustness, or replicability if you can't understand what was done or if
  key information is hidden. They're assessed first and inform
  interpretation of other signals.

  Approach-specific anchors:

  Different research types have different transparency expectations:
  - Deductive: Hypothesis pre-specification, analytical pipeline
  documentation
  - Inductive: Sampling strategy, pattern identification process
  - Methodological: Design rationale, technical specification completeness

   citations, and rationale

  Now let's work on the Foundational Clarity cluster prompt. I'll read the
  relevant reference files first:

● Search(pattern:
        ".claude/skills/research-assessor/references/credibility/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● I have the reference materials. Now drafting the cluster prompt. Key
  elements:

  Inputs: extraction.json, classification.json, track-a-quality.md
  Outputs: cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md with:
  - Comprehensibility score (0-100) with approach-specific anchors
  - Transparency score (0-100) with approach-specific anchors
  - Evidence citations from extraction
  - Cluster-level synthesis

  Key Features:

  | Component                 | Description
                                   |
  |---------------------------|---------------------------------------------
  ---------------------------------|
  | Signals assessed          | Comprehensibility (clarity) + Transparency
  (documentation)                   |
  | Approach-specific anchors | Different criteria for
  deductive/inductive/abductive/methodological          |
  | Evidence requirements     | Must cite extraction.json items (claims,
  methods, protocols, implicit items) |
  | Output structure          | Markdown report + structured YAML
                                   |
  | Quality state handling    | Precise scores for HIGH, 20-point bands for
  MODERATE                         |
  | Cluster synthesis         | Overall rating (strong/adequate/weak) +
  implications for subsequent clusters |

  Prompt Structure:
  1. Load classification context (approach, paper type)
  2. Assess Comprehensibility with approach-specific anchors
  3. Assess Transparency with approach-specific anchors
  4. Cluster synthesis across both signals
  5. Generate markdown report

  Would you like to:
  1. Test the prompt on one of the papers (sobotkova-et-al-2024 recommended
  - has track-a-quality.md already)
  2. Commit first then test
  3. Review the prompt for any adjustments

  Test Results Summary

  | Signal            | Score | Band | Key Finding
                                                         |
  |-------------------|-------|------|--------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------|
  | Comprehensibility | 78    | Good | Clear validation logic, specific
  bounded claims, but hypotheses implicit rather than formal |
  | Transparency      | 72    | Good | Comprehensive methods/protocols,
  extensive limitations discussion, but no code/data sharing |

  Cluster Rating: Strong (both signals ≥70)

  Key Observations

  Strengths identified:
  - Validation framework (prediction → test → result) is transparent
  - Claims quantified with specific metrics (87.1% false positive, 95.3%
  false negative)
  - 7 methods + 12 protocols documented
  - Explicit negative results framing (RD003)

  Gaps identified:
  - No code repository or data access
  - Computational environment under-documented
  - Validation predictions not stated as formal hypotheses

  Assessment Process Worked Well

  The prompt successfully:
  - Applied deductive-specific anchors
  - Cited specific evidence from extraction (C001, RD001, M001, P001, IA001,
   etc.)
  - Justified scores against anchor criteria
  - Generated implications for subsequent clusters

  Would you like to:
  1. Review the output in detail
  2. Commit both files (prompt + test output)
  3. Run reliability testing on Cluster 1 (like we did for classifier)

> we're running out of context, could uou please compose a /compact message 
so that we can resume smoothly? After /compact, I'd like you to double-check
 that the paper doesn't have a code repository (I thought it did), and then 
we'll commit and push. Then we'll run the reliability testing on Cluster 1. 

● Here's the compact summary:
