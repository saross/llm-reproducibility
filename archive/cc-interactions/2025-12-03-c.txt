● Variability Report: ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 (5 Runs)

  Aggregate Scores

  | Run    | Score | Verdict |
  |--------|-------|---------|
  | run-01 | 75    | Good    |
  | run-02 | 77    | Good    |
  | run-03 | 77    | Good    |
  | run-04 | 78    | Good    |
  | run-05 | 79    | Good    |

  Summary: Range = 4 points (75-79), Mean = 77.2, SD ≈ 1.5

  All 5 runs produced the same verdict band (Good) — high consistency for
  the key output.

  Key Findings

  High Consistency:
  - Implicit arguments: Perfect consistency (8/8 across all runs)
  - Aggregate scores: Tight clustering (±2 from mean)
  - Verdict band: 100% agreement (all Good)
  - Cluster ratings: All runs show Strong/Adequate-to-Strong/Strong pattern

  Moderate Variability:
  - Evidence/Claims: Run-03 is a clear outlier (26 evidence vs 43-47 for
  others)
  - Methods/Protocols: Higher variability suggests granularity differences
  in how these are bounded

  Outlier Analysis:
  - Run-03 extracted significantly fewer items but achieved the same
  aggregate score (77) — suggests the assessment framework is robust to
  extraction volume differences

  ---
  Interpretation

  The variability test demonstrates:

  1. Assessment stability: Despite 20-30% variation in extraction counts,
  aggregate scores remain within a 4-point range. The credibility assessment
   is robust to extraction granularity differences.
  2. Run-03 anomaly: Lower counts but identical verdict suggests either (a)
  more conservative item bounding or (b) different operator interpretation —
   but the assessment outcome converges.
  3. Implicit arguments stable: The 8 implicit assumptions identified are
  consistent across all runs, suggesting these represent true structural
  features of the paper.
  4. RDMAP variability expected: Methods/protocols show highest variability
  (33-38% CV), consistent with different granularity choices in how
  procedural steps are bounded.

  Bottom line: The pipeline produces reliable verdicts despite moderate
  extraction variability. This is the desired behaviour — robust assessment
  that doesn't depend on precise item counts.
