● Continuing with the assessment-schema.md update. Let me read the current
  state and complete the remaining changes.

● Read(.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/schema/assessment-schema.md)
  ⎿  Read 543 lines

● I need to make several updates to complete the schema:
  1. Fix the cluster assignment for generalisability (should be
  evidential_strength, not reproducibility_scope)
  2. Add the reproducibility_readiness object to the JSON schema
  3. Add the pillars reference to Related References
  4. Update version history

● All tasks complete. Commit 05e9706 includes:

  New files created:
  - assessment-pillars.md - Core Three Pillars framework document (325
  lines)
  - cluster-2-evidential-strength.md - Credibility pillar with 4 signals
  (626 lines)
  - cluster-3-reproducibility.md - Reproducibility pillar with readiness
  checklist (555 lines)

  Files updated:
  - SKILL.md - Terminology + pillar references
  - signal-definitions-hass.md - Replicability → Reproducibility
  - assessment-frameworks.md - Pillar context added
  - assessment-schema.md - v2.1 with reproducibility_readiness object
  - cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md - Pillar context header
  - credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md - Terminology updates

  New cluster structure:
  | Cluster | Pillar          | Signals
           |
  |---------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------
  ---------|
  | 1       | Transparency    | Comprehensibility, Transparency
           |
  | 2       | Credibility     | Plausibility, Validity, Robustness,
  Generalisability |
  | 3       | Reproducibility | Reproducibility
           |

  Note: Some secondary files (approach-taxonomy.md,
  track-a-quality-criteria.md, classify-research-approach.md) still have old
   "replicability" terminology - these can be updated in a follow-up pass if
   desired.

  Where we are:

  Just completed Phase 7 of the credibility implementation plan — the Three
  Pillars framework is now documented and propagated across core files:

  | Phase | Status     | Description                                       |
  |-------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | 1-6   | ✅ Complete | Extraction system, classification, quality gating
  |
  | 7     | ✅ Complete | Cluster prompts + Three Pillars framework
  |
  | 8     | Pending    | Cluster testing on real papers                    |
  | 9     | Pending    | Final report generation prompts                   |

  What's next:

  1. Terminology cleanup (quick task on todo) — update secondary files
  2. Phase 8: Cluster testing — run the three cluster prompts on a real
  paper (e.g., ross-ballsun-stanton-2022) to validate they work end-to-end
  3. Phase 9 — create the final credibility report generation prompt that
  consolidates all three cluster assessments

  Would you like to do the terminology cleanup now, or move straight to
  cluster testing?

> You know, while I'm thinking about it, could we add to the to-do list (a) 
specific tests of common research failure modes / biases / errors; (b) 
'sentiment analysis' type investigations of 'hype' and other rhetorical 
issues, including 'slop' (AI or otherwise) - I have bibliography for both 
(a) and (b), and I don't want to work on it now, but I've been thinking 
about it a lot lately and wanted to note it down somewhere 

● Added both as [FUTURE] items:

  1. Research failure modes / biases / errors — things like p-hacking,
  HARKing, cherry-picking, confirmation bias, survivorship bias, etc.
  2. Rhetorical analysis — hype detection, overclaiming, "slop"
  (AI-generated filler), hedging patterns, certainty inflation

  These could potentially become additional signals or a separate assessment
   layer. When you're ready to work on them, the bibliography will inform
  what specific patterns to detect and how to operationalise them.

  Current todo list:
  - [pending] Terminology cleanup (secondary files)
  - [pending] [FUTURE] Failure mode tests
  - [pending] [FUTURE] Rhetorical/sentiment analysis

remaining I
  think. 

● Let me check what we have available for ross-ballsun-stanton-2022:

● Bash(ls -la
      /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/)
  ⎿  total 480

● Good - there's an extraction.json and an older assessment. Let me check if
   there's a classification.json:

● Bash(ls /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022
      /assessment/working/)
  ⎿  claim-evidence-mappings.json

      /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/
      -name "classification*.json" -o -name "track-a*.md" 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  (No content)

● No classification.json yet — this paper predates the classification step.
  To properly test the clusters, we need:

  1. ✅ extraction.json — exists
  2. ❌ classification.json — needs Pass 8
  3. ❌ track-a-quality.md — needs quality gating

  Options:

  A. Run full pipeline — Run classification (Pass 8) → quality gating (Track
   A) → then clusters
  B. Quick manual classification — I can assess the research approach from
  the extraction and create a minimal classification.json to proceed
  directly to cluster testing

  Let me quickly check what kind of paper this is:

● Bash(jq '{title: .metadata.title, paper_type: .metadata.paper_type,
      research_design_count: (.research_designs | length), methods_count:
      (.methods | length)}' /home/s…)

      raction.json | head -50)
  ⎿ {

● This is the Ross & Ballsun-Stanton preregistration paper — a
  methodological/argumentative paper, not empirical research.

  Recommendation: Run the full pipeline to properly test the system:

  1. Pass 8: Classification (~5 min) — classify research approach
  2. Track A: Quality gating (~3 min) — assess extraction quality
  3. Cluster 1-3 assessments (~15 min total)

  This gives us a realistic end-to-end test. Shall I proceed with Pass 8
  (classification) first?

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md)
  ⎿  Read 183 lines

● This is a different task - testing the full pipeline. I have sufficient
  context from our conversation, so I'll create a new plan directly. Let me
  overwrite the existing plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Plan created. The pipeline test will run 5 steps sequentially:

  1. Pass 8: Classification → Determine research approach (expecting
  abductive)
  2. Track A: Quality Gating → Assess extraction quality (expecting HIGH)
  3. Cluster 1 → Transparency pillar (Comprehensibility + Transparency)
  4. Cluster 2 → Credibility pillar (4 signals)
  5. Cluster 3 → Reproducibility pillar (likely using Methodological
  Transparency variant since this is a non-computational paper)

  Key test aspects:
  - Abductive approach anchors (new territory - this is our first abductive
  paper)
  - Methodological Transparency variant for Cluster 3 (experimental
  alternate anchors)
  - Full Reproducibility Readiness Checklist

  Estimated time: ~25-30 minutes

  Ready to proceed when you approve.

     Pre-Execution Status

     Paper: ross-ballsun-stanton-2022
     Paper type: Methodological/argumentative (preregistration advocacy)

     Existing files:
     - ✅ extraction.json (164KB, comprehensive extraction)
     - ✅ metrics-scorecard.md (existing metrics)
     - ❌ classification.json (needs creation)
     - ❌ track-a-quality.md (needs creation)
     - ⚠️ assessment/ directory exists with OLD assessment format

     Expected research approach: Abductive (inference to best explanation 
     for how preregistration should work in archaeology)

     ---
     Step 1: Pass 8 - Research Approach Classification

     Prompt: assessment-system/prompts/classify-research-approach.md

     Inputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/extraction.json

     Outputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/classification.json
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/classification.md

     Expected classification:
     - expressed_approach: likely "none_stated" (methodological papers 
     rarely state approach)
     - revealed_approach: "abductive" (building argument for best 
     explanation)
     - primary_approach: "abductive"
     - credibility_framework_to_use: "abductive_emphasis"

     Key extraction elements to examine:
     - claims[] - structure of arguments (deductive predictions vs inductive
      patterns vs abductive inference)
     - evidence[] - types of evidence used
     - research_designs[] - stated vs implicit design
     - methods[] - analytical approach

     ---
     Step 2: Track A - Quality Gating

     Prompt: assessment-system/prompts/track-a-quality-gating.md

     Inputs:
     - extraction.json
     - classification.json (from Step 1)

     Outputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/track-a-quality.md

     Assessment criteria:
     1. Extraction confidence - Is extraction complete and accurate?
     2. Classification confidence - Is approach classification reliable?
     3. Metric-signal alignment - Do metrics support signal assessment?

     Expected quality state: HIGH or MODERATE
     - Extraction is comprehensive (164KB, multiple passes)
     - Paper structure is clear
     - Classification should be straightforward (methodological paper)

     Quality state determines:
     - HIGH → Precise scores (±5 points), narrow bands
     - MODERATE → 20-point bands, caveats required
     - LOW → No assessment (not expected for this paper)

     ---
     Step 3: Cluster 1 - Foundational Clarity

     Prompt: assessment-system/prompts/cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md

     Pillar: Transparency
     Signals: Comprehensibility (Signal 1), Transparency (Signal 2)

     Inputs:
     - extraction.json
     - classification.json
     - track-a-quality.md

     Outputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-1-foundational-c
     larity.md

     Assessment focus:
     - Comprehensibility: Are claims clear? Is argument structure traceable?
     - Transparency: Are research design and methods documented?

     Expected for methodological paper:
     - Comprehensibility likely GOOD (well-structured argument paper)
     - Transparency focus shifts to argumentation transparency rather than 
     empirical methods

     ---
     Step 4: Cluster 2 - Evidential Strength

     Prompt: assessment-system/prompts/cluster-2-evidential-strength.md

     Pillar: Credibility
     Signals: Plausibility (3), Validity (4), Robustness (5), 
     Generalisability (6)

     Inputs:
     - extraction.json
     - classification.json
     - track-a-quality.md

     Outputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-2-evidential-str
     ength.md

     Assessment focus for abductive research:
     - Plausibility: Does argument cohere with domain knowledge?
     - Validity: Is evidence sufficient for inference to best explanation?
     - Robustness: Are alternative explanations considered?
     - Generalisability: Is scope appropriately constrained?

     Abductive-specific considerations:
     - Emphasis on explanatory coherence over statistical power
     - Alternative explanation assessment is key
     - Scope constraints important for argumentative claims

     ---
     Step 5: Cluster 3 - Reproducibility

     Prompt: assessment-system/prompts/cluster-3-reproducibility.md

     Pillar: Reproducibility
     Signal: Reproducibility (7)

     Inputs:
     - extraction.json
     - classification.json
     - track-a-quality.md

     Outputs:
     - outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/cluster-3-reproducibilit
     y.md

     Key determination: Does paper have computational component?

     For this paper (methodological):
     - Likely NO computational component → Use Methodological Transparency 
     variant
     - Alternative anchors apply (experimental)
     - Focus on: procedure documentation, decision criteria, reasoning 
     traceability

     Reproducibility Readiness Checklist:
     reproducibility_readiness:
       applies: false  # (or true if any computational examples)
       pathway: "methodological_transparency_variant"
       if_not_applicable_reason: "Methodological paper without computational
      analysis"
       ...

     Output flags:
     - experimental: true (using alternate anchors)
     - pathway: "methodological_transparency_variant"

     ---
     Post-Execution Validation

     After all steps complete, verify:

     1. File structure:
     outputs/ross-ballsun-stanton-2022/assessment/
     ├── classification.json
     ├── classification.md
     ├── track-a-quality.md
     ├── cluster-1-foundational-clarity.md
     ├── cluster-2-evidential-strength.md
     └── cluster-3-reproducibility.md
     2. Consistency checks:
       - Classification approach used consistently across clusters
       - Quality state applied appropriately (caveats if MODERATE)
       - Scores reference correct approach-specific anchors
       - Reproducibility pathway correctly determined
     3. Signal coverage:
       - All 7 signals assessed
       - Each signal has: score, confidence, strengths, weaknesses, 
     justification
       - Approach-specific context provided
