● All replacements done. Let me verify no instances remain:

● Search(pattern: "replicability|Replicability", path:
        "~/Code/llm-reproducibility", glob: "*.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The remaining instances are in:
  - CLAUDE.md, README.md - Project descriptions (separate concern)
  - planning/ - Historical planning docs
  - archive/ - Superseded prompts
  - outputs/ - Generated outputs with legacy terminology

  Let me verify the core assessment system is clean:

● Search(pattern: "replicability|Replicability", path:
        ".claude/skills/research-assessor")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "replicability|Replicability", path:
        "assessment-system/prompts")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Let me check the remaining instances in the skill:

● Search(pattern: "replicability|Replicability", path: ".claude/skills/research-
        assessor/references/credibility/approach-taxonomy.md", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "replicability|Replicability", path: ".claude/skills/research-
        assessor/references/schema/assessment-schema.md", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

● Those remaining instances are legitimate:
  - Line 437: "assess replicability" in context of "Replication Studies" -
  refers to the act of replicating, not our signal name
  - Line 576: Version history noting "Renamed Replicability →
  Reproducibility" - documenting the change itself

  The assessment-system/prompts/ directory is clean. Now let me commit:

● Bash(git status)

    lity standardisation
     7 files changed, 28 insertions(+), 28 deletions(-)


● Terminology update complete. Summary:

  Completed: Updated 7 files with ~21 instances of
  "replicability/Replicability" → "reproducibility/Reproducibility"

  Files updated:
  - classify-research-approach.md (10 instances)
  - approach-taxonomy.md (2 instances)
  - track-a-quality-criteria.md (2 instances)
  - classification-schema.md (2 instances)
  - track-a-quality-gating.md (2 instances)
  - fieldwork-permits-guide.md (2 instances)
  - sobotkova-example.md (1 instance)

  Preserved (legitimate uses):
  - "Replication Studies" discussion (about study replication, not our
  signal)
  - Version history noting the terminology change

  Remaining items in project-level files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, planning/,
  archive/, outputs/) can be addressed separately if desired — these are
  descriptions/historical docs, not active assessment prompts.

> great, we're also going to pause now for some housekeeping - I'd like you 
to do a detailed investigation of (a) what documentation (readmes, 
manifests, other
  docs) need to be updated, (b) what documents (planning, outputs, 
single-use scripts, etc.) need to be moved to archive/ (nothing will be 
deleted), and (c)
  whether the organisation of both archived and active files and folders is 
optimal (I'm finding myself getting a little lost sometimes). After you've 
completed
  this investigation, we'll compact and feed the results into planning in 
the next session. 

● I'll do a systematic investigation of the project structure. Let me
  explore comprehensively.

● Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me write up the housekeeping
  investigation report:

  ---
  Housekeeping Investigation Report

  A. Documentation Needing Updates

  HIGH PRIORITY

  1. README.md (root)
  - Says "replicability" (line 6, 158, etc.) — should be "reproducibility"
  - Project status section outdated (says v2.5 completed, doesn't mention
  v2.6 or assessment)
  - References "five-pass workflow" in testing section (should be 8-pass)
  - Links to non-existent files: docs/development/schema-evolution.md,
  docs/development/deployment-guide-v2.5.md,
  docs/research-assessor-guide/overview.md,
  docs/research-assessor-guide/troubleshooting.md
  - "Planned for v2.6+" section outdated — v2.6 is released
  - Assessment framework section references
  planning/cwts_implementation_plan.md which doesn't exist

  2. CHANGELOG.md
  - Missing v2.6 entry entirely
  - "Planned for v2.6+" section at bottom is now outdated
  - Links to non-existent docs/skill-documentation/VERSION.md

  3. manifest.yaml
  - Line 70: References 03-rdmap_pass1a_explicit_prompt.md but file is named
   03-rdmap_pass1a_prompt.md
  - Missing assessment system components (cluster prompts, Three Pillars
  framework)
  - Skill version shows 2.6 but significant assessment additions have been
  made

  4. planning/README.md
  - References non-existent files: cwts_implementation_plan.md,
  implementation_plan_supplement.md, schema_improvement_plan.md,
  preliminary-work/
  - Phase status outdated — assessment framework is well underway, not
  "upcoming"

  5. docs/documentation-index.md
  - Says "7-pass workflow" repeatedly — should be "8-pass (Passes 0-7)"
  - File counts and last updated date (2025-11-13) outdated
  - References old skill-documentation paths

  MEDIUM PRIORITY

  6. docs/ subdirectory READMEs
  - docs/README.md — references outdated structure
  - Various files may reference old pass counts

  7. archive/README.md and archive-index.md
  - May need updating to reflect new archive structure

  ---
  B. Documents to Move to Archive

  C. Organisation Assessment

  Issues Identified

  1. Duplication/Confusion: Assessment References
  - Assessment docs split between:
    - assessment-system/prompts/ (active prompts)
    - .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/credibility/ (reference
  docs loaded by skill)
  - Not clear which is authoritative for what

  Recommendation: Document the division clearly OR consolidate. The skill
  references are loaded at runtime; prompts are instructions. This is
  intentional but confusing.

  2. planning/ is Cluttered
  - 22 files, many superseded or completed
  - Hard to find the current master plan
  - Some files are analyses, some are plans, some are test results

  Recommendation:
  - Archive everything except: credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md,
  README.md, fellowship/ (if active)
  - Update README.md to point to current plan

  3. outputs/ Organisation
  - Paper outputs organised well ({paper-slug}/)
  - But also contains: corpus profiles (timestamped), test results, batch
  metrics
  - These should probably be separated

  Recommendation: Create structure:
  outputs/
  ├── {paper-slug}/           # Paper-specific outputs
  ├── corpus-analysis/        # Corpus-level profiles and metrics
  └── testing/                # Reliability tests, comparisons

  4. archive/ Is Complex but Reasonable
  - Current structure makes sense (by version, by type)
  - Could use better README/index
  - archive/planning-completed/ exists but not fully used

  Recommendation: Archive is OK, just needs additions from planning/

  5. outputs.backup-pre-migration/ Should Be in archive/
  - This is clearly historical backup data
  - Currently at root level cluttering the project

  Recommendation: Move to archive/outputs-backup-pre-migration/

  6. scripts/ is Minimal
  - Only contains install-git-hooks.sh
  - batch-assess.py and planning/quick_infrastructure_scan.py could go here

  Recommendation: Consolidate scripts

  7. docs/ vs .claude/skills/
  - docs/research-assessor-guide/ duplicates/complements skill references
  - Not clear which is user-facing vs internal

  Recommendation: Clarify in README or consolidate

  ⎿  Conversation exported to: archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-29-b.txt

> some feedback: (a) consolidate wherever it makes sense and improves the 
situation, even if it is *somewhat* more work (rather than documenting 
unconsolidated
  situations), (b) while I want you to update language (e.g., replication 
vs. reproduciton) in active documents, don't change it in stale / superceded
 / archived
  documents, we want to keep an accurate history of the project, (c) 
fellowship/ and similar overview files should be kept active for now, (d) 
overall your
  archiving has been a little too aggressive; if it's reasonably clear do it
 (it can always be reversed), if in doubt ask me. Overall I agree with your 
suggestions
  for improved organisation. With this in mind, I think we have the context 
to make a plan. 

● Let me read the existing plan file and then create a new plan for this
  housekeeping task.

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md)
  ⎿  Read 71 lines

● This is a different task (housekeeping) from the previous plan
  (terminology update which is now complete). I already have extensive
  context from my investigation in this conversation, so I can proceed
  directly to creating the plan. Let me write a comprehensive housekeeping
  plan incorporating your feedback.

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Plan drafted. I have a few clarifying questions before finalising:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should gpt51-feedback/ be kept active in planning/ or archived? → 
     Archive
     · Is fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md still active work or should 
     it be archived? → Keep active

     · Is active-todo-list.md actively used? (I haven't seen it referenced 
     in workflows) → Keep active

● Let me update the plan with your decisions:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md

● Plan is finalised with your decisions incorporated. Summary:

  Phase 1 - Documentation Updates:
  - README.md, CHANGELOG.md, manifest.yaml, planning/README.md,
  docs/documentation-index.md

  Phase 2 - Archive (14 files + 1 directory):
  - 13 superseded planning docs + gpt51-feedback/ →
  archive/planning-completed/

  Keep Active:
  - credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md, active-todo-list.md,
  fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md, fellowship/

  Phase 3 - Reorganise:
  - outputs.backup-pre-migration/ → archive/
  - Create outputs/corpus-analysis/ and outputs/testing/
  - Consolidate scripts/

  Ready for execution in next session.

     Project Housekeeping Plan

     Date: 2025-11-29
     Purpose: Documentation updates, archiving, and reorganisation
     Scope: Based on investigation completed in this session

     ---
     Guiding Principles (from user feedback)

     1. Consolidate where it improves the situation, even if more work
     2. Preserve history — don't change terminology in 
     archived/stale/superseded docs
     3. Keep active: fellowship/, overview files, and similar planning docs
     4. Conservative archiving — if in doubt, ask

     ---
     Phase 1: Critical Documentation Updates

     1.1 README.md (root)

     Changes:
     - Update terminology: "replicability" → "reproducibility" (lines 6, 
     158, 288)

     Phase 2: Archiving Superseded Planning Docs

     Move to archive/planning-completed/:

     | File                                             | Reason            
             |
     |--------------------------------------------------|-------------------
     --------|
     | assessment-implementation-plan.md                | Superseded by v2.0
             |
     | credibility-assessment-implementation-roadmap.md | Superseded        
             |
     | credibility-implementation-plan-detailed.md      | Superseded by v2.0
             |
     | corpus-interpretation-framework.md               | Integrated into 
     main plan |
     | extraction-assessment-rubric-v1.md               | Superseded        
             |
     | extraction-metrics-guidance-analysis.md          | Historical 
     analysis       |
     | extraction-to-analysis-transition.md             | Historical 
     transition doc |
     | paper-credibility-analysis-framework.md          | Superseded        
             |
     | pass6-phase1-testing-findings.md                 | Completed testing 
             |
     | pass6-software-documentation-enhancement.md      | Completed         
             |
     | research-approach-classification-framework.md    | Superseded by 
     prompts     |
     | secondary-source-attribution-analysis.md         | Completed analysis
             |
     | synthesis-external-feedback.md                   | Historical 
     feedback       |

     Keep active in planning/:
     - credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md (current master plan)
     - active-todo-list.md (confirmed active)
     - fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md (confirmed active)
     - fellowship/ directory (per user request)
     - README.md (update, don't archive)

     Also archive:
     - gpt51-feedback/ → move to archive/planning-completed/

     Scripts:
     - Move quick_infrastructure_scan.py to scripts/ (consolidate scripts)

     ---
     Phase 3: File Reorganisation

     3.1 Move outputs.backup-pre-migration/ to archive/

     mv outputs.backup-pre-migration/ archive/outputs-backup-pre-migration/

     This is clearly historical backup data and shouldn't be at root level.

     3.2 Reorganise outputs/

     Create cleaner structure:

     outputs/
     ├── {paper-slug}/           # Paper-specific outputs (keep as-is)
     ├── corpus-analysis/        # NEW: Move corpus profiles here
     │   └── corpus-profile-2025-11-16-0724.md  # Keep only latest
     └── testing/                # NEW: Move test results here
         ├── classifier-reliability-test-2025-11-28.md
         └── cluster-1-reliability-test-2025-11-28.md

     Archive duplicate corpus profiles:
     - Keep: corpus-profile-2025-11-16-0724.md (latest)
     - Archive: 6 older timestamped versions

     3.3 Consolidate scripts/

     Move to scripts/:
     - batch-assess.py (from root)
     - quick_infrastructure_scan.py (from planning/)

     Result: All utility scripts in one place.

     ---
     Phase 4: Update Archive Index

     After moving files, update:
     - archive/README.md
     - archive/archive-index.md

     To reflect new additions (planning-completed files, outputs backup).

     ---

  details needed to execute the housekeeping.

  Quick summary for next session:
  - 5 documentation files to update (terminology, versions, broken links)
  - 14 planning files + gpt51-feedback/ to archive
  - File reorganisation (outputs structure, scripts consolidation)
  - Single commit at the end

smoothly in the next session. 

● Here's a compact message for the next session:

  ---
  Session context: Project housekeeping - documentation updates, archiving,
  and reorganisation.

  Plan file: /home/shawn/.claude/plans/parallel-wiggling-narwhal.md contains
   the complete approved plan.

  Summary of work:
  1. Phase 1 - Documentation updates: README.md, CHANGELOG.md,
  manifest.yaml, planning/README.md, docs/documentation-index.md (fix
  terminology, versions, broken links, pass counts)
  2. Phase 2 - Archive planning docs: Move 13 superseded files +
  gpt51-feedback/ to archive/planning-completed/
  3. Phase 3 - Reorganise: Move outputs.backup-pre-migration/ to archive/,
  create outputs/corpus-analysis/ and outputs/testing/, consolidate scripts
  in scripts/
  4. Phase 4 - Update archive indexes

  Key rules: Don't change terminology in archived docs (preserve history).
  Keep active: credibility-implementation-plan-v2.0.md, active-todo-list.md,
   fair-vocabularies-development-plan.md, fellowship/.

  Start by: Reading the plan file, then execute phases in order. Single
  commit at end.
