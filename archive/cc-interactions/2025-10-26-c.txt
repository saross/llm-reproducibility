● I'll create a compact continuation message for you:

  CONTINUATION REQUEST: Pass 1 Claims & Evidence Liberal Extraction

  Current Status:
  - File: /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/extraction.json
  - Progress: 46 evidence items, 49 claims, 0 implicit arguments
  - Sections completed: Abstract, Introduction, Methods 2.1-2.5 (complete)
  - Current task: Pass 1 (Claims & Evidence Liberal extraction) - section-by-section

  Next Action:
  Continue liberal extraction from Results section 3.1-3.5 (pages 7-9), which contains extensive quantitative evidence
  including:
  - Staff time measurements (hours for setup, support, accuracy-checking)
  - Volunteer digitization rates (features per hour, total features)
  - Desktop GIS comparison data
  - Application performance metrics
  - Data quality measurements (error rates, omission rates)

  Then proceed through Discussion 4.1-4.3 and Conclusion section 5.

  Instructions:
  - Continue autonomous section-by-section extraction (no confirmation needed)
  - Liberal over-extraction strategy: when uncertain, INCLUDE IT
  - Extract ALL quantitative measurements as evidence
  - Mandatory safety: Read full file → Write → Validate with jq
  - Source all items with verbatim_quote (complete sentences only)

  Command to continue:
  "Please continue Pass 1 liberal extraction from Results section 3.1, extracting all evidence and claims before moving
  to the next section."

  Copy this message and paste it after CC restarts to resume exactly where you left off.
