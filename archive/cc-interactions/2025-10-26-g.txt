Session Summary: QA System Enhancement & Prompt Optimisation

Primary Accomplishments

1. Created QA/QI Assessment Prompt v3 (Comprehensive)
- Developed enhanced 647-line QA/QI prompt with clear separation
- PART 1: Automated Checks (6 checks, 5-min runtime, 80% automation)
- PART 2: Manual QA (3 checks) - Find errors & inconsistencies
- PART 3: Manual QI (4 optimisations) - Reduce bloat & increase clarity
- PART 4: Extraction Validation Test
- PART 5: Automated QA Script documentation
- Restored all 4 critical optimisations lost in v2:
  * Duplication Analysis (consistency + lean prompts)
  * Streamlining Opportunities (identify verbose sections)
  * Checklist Standardisation (consistency + performance)
  * Example Quality (prevent outdated patterns)
- Result: 40-min comprehensive assessment vs 4-6 hours manual
- File: extraction-system/prompts/QA_QI_PROMPT_v3.md

2. Fixed All QA Check Issues
- Fix 1: WORKFLOW.md path bug (extraction-system/staging/WORKFLOW.md)
- Fix 2: Field name regex (eliminate false positives from partial matches)
- Fix 3: Terminology check scope (exclude QA documentation)
- Fix 4: Field consistency filtering (exclude validation report fields)
- Result: ✅ 9/9 checks PASS, 0 warnings, 0 failures
- File: extraction-system/qa-checks.sh

3. Implemented Phase 1 QI Optimisation (Low-Risk, High-Impact)
- Moved 107-line JSON validation report template from prompt to separate file
- Created: extraction-system/templates/validation_report_template.json (113 lines with comments)
- Modified: 05-rdmap_pass3_prompt.md (591 → 506 lines, -85 lines)
- Impact: 10× better safety margin (9 → 94 lines from 600-line limit)
- Risk: Very low (purely structural, all QA checks pass)
- Benefit: Better prompt/template separation, improved maintainability

4. Cleaned Schema Architecture (Eliminated Duplication)
- Problem: 3 copies of extraction_schema.json, 2 out of date (missing v2.6.2)
- Solution: Removed redundant copies from skill (142KB reduction)
  * Deleted: extraction-system/skill/.../schema/extraction_schema.json
  * Deleted: .claude/skills/.../schema/extraction_schema.json
  * Kept: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json (canonical)
- Updated schema-guide.md to v2.6.2 (both skill locations)
  * Added: Research Design conditional objects FULLY OPTIONAL documentation
  * Impact: Extractors can create minimal RDs with just 3 required fields
- Updated README.md files (version 2.5 → 2.6.2, both skill locations)
- Result: Single source of truth, no duplication, eliminated drift risk

Key Technical Details

QA/QI Prompt v3 Structure:
- Automated checks catch 80% of routine issues in 5 minutes
- Clear separation enables targeted use:
  * Post-change: Automated + QA checks (20 min)
  * Monthly optimisation: Automated + QI optimisations (30 min)
  * Full assessment: Everything (40 min)
- All 3 core imperatives supported:
  (a) Consistency: Cross-document checks, terminology, contradictions
  (b) Lean prompts: Duplication analysis, streamlining, prompt/skill division
  (c) Performance: Sourcing requirements, liberal extraction, output consistency

Phase 1 QI Optimisation Results:
- Before: 05-rdmap_pass3_prompt.md = 591 lines (1.5% margin from limit)
- After: 05-rdmap_pass3_prompt.md = 506 lines (15.7% margin from limit)
- Line savings: 85 lines (-14%)
- Safety margin improvement: 10× better
- Template: Comprehensive JSON structure with inline comments
- Prompt: 18-line reference with key sections summary

Schema Architecture (Clean):
- Canonical: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json (provided in context)
- Human-readable guide: skill/.../schema/schema-guide.md (referenced by prompts)
- No duplication, clear ownership, single maintenance path
- v2.6.2 update: RD conditional objects fully optional (reduces consolidation pressure)

Automated QA Test Results:
✅ CHECK 0: File Sync Status - PASS
✅ CHECK 1: Schema-Prompt Field Consistency - PASS
✅ CHECK 2: Skill Reference Accuracy - PASS
✅ CHECK 3: Terminology Consistency - PASS
✅ CHECK 4: Critical Sourcing Requirements - PASS
✅ CHECK 5: Liberal Extraction Emphasis - PASS
✅ CHECK 6: Regression Watch (safety rules, RDMAP reminders, RD guide) - PASS
✅ STATUS: All checks passed

Deferred Optimisations (Future Sessions)

Phase 2 QI Optimisations Available (45 additional lines):
- Priority 2: Compress section-by-section extraction procedure (01-claims-evidence_pass1)
  * Move detailed 51-line procedure to skill reference
  * Keep compressed 25-line version in prompt
  * Savings: 25 lines, Risk: Medium

- Priority 3: Compress consolidation procedure (04-rdmap_pass2)
  * Move examples to skill reference
  * Keep decision criteria in prompt
  * Savings: 20 lines, Risk: Medium

Decision: Deferred Phase 2 (medium-risk optimisations) to future session
Rationale: Phase 1 achieved excellent results (85 lines), conservative approach preferred

Next Steps (User-Requested)

1. Continue extraction work with improved QA system
   - Use automated checks: `./extraction-system/qa-checks.sh full`
   - Run after any prompt/schema changes
   - 5-min runtime for comprehensive check

2. Optional: Run Phase 2 QI optimisations when needed
   - Plan available: /tmp/qi-optimization-plan.md
   - Additional 45 lines savings potential
   - Medium risk, requires testing

3. Monitor extraction quality
   - Validate v2.6.2 RD simplification improves extraction
   - Check that minimal RDs reduce consolidation pressure
   - Verify validation template format works correctly
