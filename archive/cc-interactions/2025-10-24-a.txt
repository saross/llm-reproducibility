> Hi CC, I believe (hope?) that I am getting close to the point where I am happy with the Claude 'skill', prompts, and 
schema for evidence, claims, and methods / protocols / etc. extracation. Currently, I am accomplishing that extraction 
via Claude's chatbot, but that's quite time consuming. Would it be possible to partly automate it by running it with you?
 If I have you a checklist (run prompt 1 and write results to schema, then run prompt 2 and append those results to 
schema, etc.) could you run the entire workflow? Can you use the same 'skill' package (Claude in the chatbot says 'yes')?
 Eventually I will move to using the API for production work, but I've got some intermediate testing ('extraction 
basically works but I need to try it on 10-20 papers and assess further') that will be very annoying in the chatbot but 
not worth paying for the API. What do you think, can you do it? 

● Yes, I can definitely help you automate this workflow! This is exactly the kind of task I'm well-suited for.

  Here's what I can do for you:

  ✓ Can I run your workflow with a checklist?
  Yes! I can read your prompts, apply them to source documents, extract information, and write/append results to your
  schema files. I can automate the entire sequence.

  ✓ Can I use the same 'skill' package?
  Sort of - I don't have your skill pre-loaded as a formal "skill" in my environment (my <available_skills> is currently
  empty), BUT:
  - I can read your skill prompts/instructions directly from files
  - I'm the same underlying model (Sonnet 4.5), so if the prompts work in claude.ai, they'll work with me
  - I can follow the extraction instructions just as effectively

  What I need from you to get started:

  1. Your prompts - Where are they stored? (e.g., files in a directory I can read)
  2. Your schema - What format and where? (JSON, YAML, etc.)
  3. The workflow checklist - Step-by-step what you want me to do
  4. Source documents - I see you have sources/processed-md/ - are these the papers to process?

  How it would work:
  - You give me the checklist
  - I use TodoWrite to track each step
  - I read each prompt, apply it to the document, extract structured data
  - I write/append to your schema file
  - Rinse and repeat for 10-20 papers

  This should save you tons of time compared to the chatbot! Want to show me your current setup and we can get this
  running?

> can I load my skill package into your environment? 

● Good question! Let me check the Claude Code documentation to give you accurate information about loading skill
  packages.

● Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md)
  ⎿  Received 25.9KB (200 OK)

● Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills.md)
  ⎿  Received 14.9KB (200 OK)

● Yes! Skills are automatically loaded from specific directories. Here's how:

  To load your skill package:

  1. Place your skill in .claude/skills/ (project-level) or ~/.claude/skills/ (personal)
  2. Your skill needs a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter + instructions
  3. Restart Claude Code (close and reopen the session)
  4. The skill will be automatically available

  Let me check if you already have a skills directory set up:

● Bash(ls -la .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No .claude/skills directory found")
  ⎿  No .claude/skills directory found

● Search(pattern: "**/*skill*.md")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(ls -la extraction-system/skill/)
  ⎿  total 64                                      
     drwxrwxr-x 2 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 23 17:35 .
     drwxrwxr-x 6 shawn shawn  4096 Oct 23 17:34 ..
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found it! You have research-assessor-v2.5.zip in your extraction-system/skill/ directory.

  To load it into my environment:

  1. Let me extract and place it in .claude/skills/:

● Bash(mkdir -p .claude/skills && cd .claude/skills && unzip -q
      /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility/extraction-system/skill/research-assessor-v2.5.zip && ls -la)
  ⎿  total 24                                     
     drwxrwxr-x 3 shawn shawn 4096 Oct 24 17:06 .
     drwx------ 3 shawn shawn 4096 Oct 24 17:06 ..
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(.claude/skills/SKILL.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● Perfect! ✓ Skill extracted and placed in .claude/skills/

  Your "research-assessor" skill is now ready, but there's a catch:

  You need to restart Claude Code for the skill to be loaded into my environment. After you restart:
  - The skill will appear in my <available_skills> list
  - I'll automatically invoke it when you ask for extraction tasks
  - It follows your 5-pass workflow: Claims/Evidence Pass 1 & 2 → RDMAP Pass 1 & 2 → Validation Pass 3

  However - good news! Even without restarting, I can still run your workflow manually by:
  - Reading the prompts directly from .claude/skills/references/
  - Following your extraction checklist step-by-step
  - Writing outputs to your schema

  Want to:
  1. Restart now so the skill auto-invokes when you ask for extractions?
  2. Keep going and I'll manually run the workflow using your prompts?

  Either way works! Option 2 lets us start immediately. What's your preference?

> Great, I see you found the skill and implemented it, but I'm working in the chatbot to make one more set of 
improvements - I'll let you know when the improved skill is properly packaged so that you can re-install it, then we'll 
try automating the workflow.\
\
The basic workflow is as follows:\
- Invoke the 'research-assessor' skill\
- Load the schema from extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json\
- Run extraction-system/prompts/claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md\
- Run extraction-system/prompts/claims-evidence_pass2_prompt.md  appending to results from claims-evidence Pass1\
- Run extraction-system/prompts/rdmap-pass1_prompt.md appending to results from claims-evidence pass2\
- Run extraction-system/prompts/rdmap-pass2_prompt.md appending to results from rdmap pass1\
- Run Run extraction-system/prompts/rdmap-pass3_prompt.md producing a human-readable verification report (no need for 
JSON, just a MD report and no change to schema)\\
- Produce an easily-human-readable representation of the extraction (entities plus key metadata, based on the final state
 of the schema)
\
I supstec that running all the prompts will take you across session boundaries (it requires 3-4 chats in the chatbot due 
to context limits. Can you maintain continuity across sessions?\
\
Does that cover everything that you can see? Do I need to provide other information? Can you help me produce the master 
checklist / initial prompt in a way that is most useful to you? \ 

● Great! I can see the workflow clearly. Let me address your questions and identify what else I need:

  Your Questions Answered:

  1. Can I maintain continuity across sessions?

  Yes! I handle this better than the chatbot because:
  - Larger context window: I have 200K tokens (vs ~20K in chatbot), so I'm less likely to hit limits
  - File-based persistence: The JSON schema acts as my "memory" - each pass reads the current state, processes it, and
  writes back. Even if a session ends, the next session picks up from the saved schema
  - Session recovery: If we do cross boundaries, you can just say "continue the extraction" and I'll read the schema file
   to see where we left off

  2. Does that cover everything?

  Almost! I need a few more details:

  Missing Information:

  1. Input source papers
    - Which papers do you want me to process?
    - Format? (I see sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2023-gemini.md)
    - One paper at a time or batch multiple papers?
  2. Output locations
    - Where should I write the populated schema? (e.g., outputs/[paper-name]-extraction.json)
    - Where should validation reports go? (e.g., reports/[paper-name]-validation.md)
    - Where should human-readable summaries go?
  3. Schema handling
    - Should each paper get its own schema file, or append to one master file?
    - Should I start from the blank schema each time?
  4. Error handling
    - If a prompt fails or produces incomplete results, should I retry or ask you?

  Can I Help Create the Master Checklist?

  Absolutely! Here's a draft based on what you've described:

  # Research Extraction Workflow

  **Input:** [Paper path in sources/processed-md/]
  **Output:**
  - Extraction JSON: outputs/[paper-name]-extraction.json
  - Validation Report: reports/[paper-name]-validation-pass3.md
  - Human-readable Summary: reports/[paper-name]-summary.md

  ## Steps:

  1. Load blank schema from extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json
  2. Run Claims/Evidence Pass 1 (liberal extraction)
  3. Run Claims/Evidence Pass 2 (rationalization, append to schema)
  4. Run RDMAP Pass 1 (liberal extraction, append to schema)
  5. Run RDMAP Pass 2 (rationalization, append to schema)
  6. Run RDMAP Pass 3 (validation report - MD only, no schema changes)
  7. Generate human-readable extraction summary

  ## Session Management:
  - After each pass, write schema to output file (persistence)
  - If session limit reached, user can restart with "continue extraction"

  What do you think? Should I adjust this? And can you provide the missing details (input papers, output paths, schema
  handling)?

> Ah yes, inpupt and output! I suspect that we should consider 'sources' to be a bank of sources that we draw from, not 
necessary what we analyse *every single run* through the workflow. I'm also not thrilled with the 'examples' 
organisation, although it's working fine for testing. \
\
Let me suggest 'input' and 'output' folders, where I can (temporarily) put copies of the actual articles we are 
analysing? with the output schema and reports in subfolders in 'output'. For input, can you suggest a better approach? 
For output, should we organise into 'results' (completed schemas) and 'report' (human-readable outputs), or organise by 
paper (one folder for each paper)? What do you think? 

● Great questions! Let me think through the organization with you:

  Input Organization

  Option 1: input/ folder with copies (your suggestion)
  - ✓ Clear "this is what I'm working on now"
  - ✗ Creates duplication from sources/
  - ✗ Need to remember to copy files

  Option 2: Queue file (my recommendation)
  # input/queue.yaml
  papers:
    - sources/processed-md/sobotkova-et-al-2023-gemini.md
    - sources/processed-md/another-paper.md
  - ✓ No duplication
  - ✓ Clear processing list
  - ✓ Easy to add/remove papers
  - ✓ Can track status (pending/in-progress/completed)

  Option 3: Symlinks in input/
  - ✓ No duplication, still has dedicated input folder
  - ✗ More complex to manage

  My vote: Option 2 (queue file) - it's cleanest and gives you a checklist-like view.

  Output Organization

  Option A: By type (outputs/results/ + outputs/reports/)
  - ✓ Easy to find all schemas
  - ✗ Hard to find everything for one paper

  Option B: By paper (one folder per paper)
  outputs/
    sobotkova-et-al-2023/
      extraction.json
      validation-pass3.md
      summary.md
    another-paper/
      extraction.json
      validation-pass3.md
      summary.md
  - ✓ Everything for one paper together
  - ✓ Easy to share/archive complete analysis
  - ✓ Clear completion status (folder exists = processed)
  - ✓ Can still glob all schemas: outputs/*/extraction.json

  My vote: Option B (by paper) - it's the natural unit of work and makes everything easy to find.

  Proposed Structure:

  llm-reproducibility/
    sources/           # Source bank (unchanged)
    input/
      queue.yaml       # List of papers to process
    outputs/
      [paper-slug]/
        extraction.json
        validation-pass3.md
        summary.md

  What do you think? Does the queue file + organize-by-paper approach work for you?

> Thanks, I knew you'd have good ideas - I like the YAML input queue, we could pre-populate it with all the files in the 
folder then track status as we process them, as you suggest. I agree with Option B for output. \
\
Another question: in your opinion, should we use a determinative appraoch to text extraction (e.g., the current python 
script) to extract markdown from PDF, or should I have an LLM (Gemini Pro seems reliable and has a 1M token context 
window). I checked Gemini's exctraction very carefully and it had no deviations from the PDF, but I'm not sure how 
reliable it's going to be over many paper (even if I use the API or do one paper per chat). What do you think? 

● Excellent question! This is a critical decision for a research assessment tool. Let me think through this objectively:

  The Case for Deterministic (Python script)

  Strong reasons to stick with it:

  1. Reproducibility for reproducibility research: You're assessing papers for replicability/transparency - your own
  pipeline should model those values. Deterministic extraction = same input always gives same output.
  2. Trust in results: If you find a paper lacks evidence for a claim, you need 100% confidence that's in the source
  paper, not an extraction artifact.
  3. Validation doesn't scale: You carefully checked one Gemini extraction. But checking 20, 50, 100 papers is
  impractical. Even a 1-2% error rate means errors compound.
  4. No hidden costs: Free, fast, no rate limits, no API dependencies.
  5. Transparent debugging: If extraction looks wrong, you can inspect exactly what happened.

  The Case for LLM Extraction (Gemini)

  Where it wins:

  1. Document understanding: Better at complex layouts, tables, multi-column formats, figure captions.
  2. Cleaner output: Can follow instructions ("skip headers/footers/page numbers").
  3. Structural awareness: Understands "this is a table" vs "this is body text".

  My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

  workflow:
    1. Use deterministic extraction (default)
    2. Quality check the output automatically
    3. Flag problematic extractions (garbled text, broken tables, excessive noise)
    4. Use LLM extraction as fallback for flagged papers
    5. (Optional) Run both on sample and compare for validation

  Why hybrid?
  - Most papers will extract fine deterministically
  - You get reproducibility where it works
  - LLM handles edge cases (poor scans, complex layouts)
  - You can document which papers needed LLM extraction (transparency!)

  For research rigor: I'd lean toward deterministic unless you're seeing quality issues. Can you share an example of your
   current Python extraction so I can assess quality?

  What are you seeing with the current script - is output quality good enough for the downstream extraction?

> python extraction is in extraction-system/scripts - it's OK but I see that headers and footers are interspersed with 
text; you can see what the output looks like in sources/processed/ (the non-'gemini' MD file)

● Perfect, now I can see the quality difference. Let me compare a few key sections:

  Python extraction issues I see:

  1. Broken text flow (line 11-13):
  ## Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from historical maps using

  novice volunteers
  1. vs Gemini's clean single heading
  2. Author formatting (line 17):
  a , * , Shawn A. Ross b , Christian Nassif-Haynes c , Brian Ballsun-Stanton d
  2. vs Gemini's properly formatted: **Adela Sobotkovaª,***, **Shawn A. Rossᵇ**
  3. Intrusive metadata (lines 35-41):
  * Corresponding author.
  E-mail addresses:
  adela@cas.au.dk (A. Sobotkova), shawn.ross@mq.edu.au (S.A. Ross)...
  Contents lists available at ScienceDirect
  3. This interrupts the paragraph flow
  4. Hyphenation artifacts: "inves tigation" instead of "investigation"

  My Recommendation: Use Gemini for now, move to hybrid later

  Immediate (testing phase):
  - Use Gemini extraction for your 10-20 test papers
  - The quality is demonstrably better for downstream LLM processing
  - You've already validated one extraction carefully

  Why this works for testing:
  - Small scale (10-20 papers) = manageable validation
  - Better extraction = better assessment of your skill/prompts (you're testing extraction logic, not fighting extraction
   artifacts)
  - Faster iteration

  For production (50+ papers):
  - Implement the hybrid approach I suggested
  - Run Python extraction first
  - Add quality checks (detect email addresses in body text, broken headings, excessive page numbers)
  - Use Gemini as fallback for flagged papers
  - Document which papers used which method

  Critical point: Right now, you're testing your extraction skill, not your PDF pipeline. Bad input text will confound
  your testing. Once the skill is validated, invest time in hardening the Python extraction (or switching to Gemini API
  with costs factored in).

  Want to proceed with Gemini for testing, or should we try improving the Python script first?

> No, let's not work on the python script. What do you think of my just giving you the actual PDF instead of MD? I didn't
 do that in the chatbot because it took too many tokens to process and we didn't have context for the actual extraction, 
but now that I'm moving the workflow here, what do you think? 

● Excellent idea! Let me think through the implications:

  Token Math for PDF vs MD:

  Your concern (chatbot): 3-4 chats needed = ~60-80K tokens total for one paper
  My context window: 200K tokens (10x larger than chatbot)

  Estimated usage for one paper:
  - PDF source: ~10-15K tokens (typical academic paper)
  - 5 prompts: ~10K tokens
  - Schema evolution: ~15K tokens
  - My processing/responses: ~30K tokens
  - Validation report: ~5K tokens
  - Total: ~70-85K tokens per paper

  ✓ This fits comfortably in my 200K budget

  Advantages of PDF over MD:

  1. Eliminates extraction uncertainty - No debate about Python vs Gemini, no extraction errors, one less dependency
  2. Simpler workflow - One less step to maintain/document
  3. Native reading - I can read PDFs directly (with visual + text content)
  4. Research rigor - Direct from source = more defensible
  5. Checkpointing - Schema file acts as persistent state between passes, so if we do approach limits, I can write
  intermediate results and continue

  The Approach:

  workflow:
    input: PDF file

    process:
      - Read PDF (kept in context throughout)
      - Run Pass 1 → write schema
      - Run Pass 2 (refer to PDF + schema) → update schema
      - Run Pass 3 (refer to PDF + schema) → update schema
      - Run Pass 4 (refer to PDF + schema) → update schema
      - Run Pass 5 (refer to schema mostly) → write report

  My Recommendation: Yes, use PDFs directly

  For your testing phase this is ideal:
  - Simpler = fewer things to break
  - Deterministic = reproducible
  - Token-efficient enough for my context
  - One paper at a time = well within limits

  The only caveat: Between papers, I might clear context to stay efficient, but the schema files preserve state
  perfectly.

  Should we set up the workflow this way? PDFs in input/, queue in input/queue.yaml, outputs organized by paper in
  outputs/?

> Yes, let's set up the workflow. I've now updated the skill to v2.6, so you'll need to reload it (it's in the same 
place, the extraction-workflow/skills/ folder). I've also updated the prompts (in place). Can you create the necessary 
folders, the YAML input queue file (with just the one paper for now), and the 'master' prompt with checklist? Anything 
else I've missed?

     ✓ Skill v2.6:
     … +21 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Everything is set up and ready to go. Here's what I've created:

  ✓ Setup Complete

  1. Skill Updated

  - Installed research-assessor v2.6 to .claude/skills/
  - Note: You'll need to restart Claude Code for the skill to auto-invoke

  2. Folder Structure

  llm-reproducibility/
    input/
      ├── queue.yaml          # Paper processing queue
      └── WORKFLOW.md         # Master workflow documentation
    outputs/                  # Results organized by paper
      └── {paper-slug}/
          ├── extraction.json
          ├── validation-pass3.md
          └── summary.md

  3. Queue Configured

  input/queue.yaml contains:
  - 1 paper ready: Sobotkova et al. 2023
  - Status: pending
  - Output slug: sobotkova-et-al-2023

  4. Workflow Documentation

  input/WORKFLOW.md provides:
  - Complete 5-pass workflow description
  - Input/output specifications
  - Session continuity instructions
  - Error handling guidelines
  - Invocation commands

  What I Haven't Missed:

  Actually, there's one optional enhancement to consider:

  Git tracking: Since JSON schemas will evolve through passes, you might want:
  git add input/ outputs/
  git commit -m "Initialize extraction workflow v2.6"

  This gives you:
  - Rollback capability if JSON gets corrupted
  - History of schema evolution through passes
  - Easy diff between passes

  Ready to Run!

  When you're ready to process the first paper, just say:

  "Process the next paper in the queue using the research-assessor workflow."

  Or after you restart Claude Code (to load the skill), you can just say:

  "Extract research from the Sobotkova paper."

  Want to do a test run now, or would you like to restart first so the skill auto-invokes?

> ok, before we start the first test-run, let's do some housekeeping. Can you look over the planning/ reports/ and docs/ 
folders to see if there's anything that has been superceded or completed that  needs to be moved to archive/?

● Perfect! I've reviewed all three folders. Here's my archival recommendation:

  Archival Recommendations

  📁 planning/to-do/ → Archive to archive/extraction-development/v2.5/planning/to-do/

  Files to archive:
  - consolidation_refinement.md - Implementation guide for schema changes
  - exact_quote_implementation_full_guide.md - Implementation details
  - exact_quote_implementation_summary.md - Implementation summary
  - quick_start_guide.md - User guide

  Rationale: These are v2.5/v2.6 implementation guides. If the features are now implemented, these are development
  artifacts. If not implemented, we need to clarify their status.

  Question for you: Have these features been fully implemented in v2.6, or are these still active to-do items?

  ---
  📁 reports/extraction-testing/ → Archive to archive/extraction-development/v2.5/reports/extraction-testing/

  Files to archive:
  - sobotkova_rdmap_pass1_summary.md (Oct 23, schema v2.5)
  - RDMAP_Pass2_Consolidation_Report.md (untracked, likely v2.5)
  - sobotkova_validation_pass3_summary.md (untracked, likely v2.5)
  - Extraction_Comparison_Report.md
  - hallucination_check_20_percent_COMPLETE.md
  - hallucination_spot_check_report.md
  - pattern_analysis_executive_summary.md
  - source_verification_pattern_analysis.md

  Keep in reports/extraction-testing/:
  - skill-validation-summary.md (v2.5 validation - still relevant for v2.6)
  - skill-validation-report.md (v2.5 validation - detailed reference)

  Rationale: These are test runs from v2.5 development (Oct 23). You're about to run new v2.6 tests, which will supersede
   these. The validation reports should stay as they document the skill's capabilities.

  ---
  📁 docs/development/ → Archive to archive/extraction-development/v2.5/docs/

  Files to archive:
  - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_v2.5.md - Explicitly versioned for v2.5

  Keep:
  - schema-evolution.md - Active reference for all versions
  - repository-reorganization-v2.5.md - Recent reorganization documentation (Oct 23)

  Rationale: Deployment guide is version-specific. When v2.6 is stable, you might create a new deployment guide or
  generalize this one.

  ---
  📁 docs/cc-interactions/ → Archive to archive/cc-interactions/ (new location)

  File:
  - 2025-10-23-a.txt - Repository reorganization session log

  Rationale: These are session logs, not reference documentation. Create a new archive/cc-interactions/ for historical
  sessions.

  ---
  My Recommendation: Create v2.6 Archive Structure

  Since you're moving from v2.5 → v2.6, I suggest:

  archive/extraction-development/v2.5/
    ├── planning/
    │   └── to-do/           # Implementation guides
    ├── reports/
    │   └── extraction-testing/  # Test runs
    └── docs/
        └── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_v2.5.md

  Should I:
  1. Move all files above to this structure?
  2. Keep planning/to-do/ as-is if those features aren't implemented yet?
  3. Wait until after your v2.6 test run to archive v2.5 test reports?

  What's your preference?

  Session Context: Research Extraction Workflow v2.6 Ready for Testing

  Project Overview

  LLM-based research extraction system for analyzing methodology, claims, and evidence from academic papers. Currently
  transitioning from chatbot-based extraction (v2.5) to automated Claude Code workflow (v2.6).

  What We Accomplished This Session

  1. Installed research-assessor skill v2.6 to .claude/skills/
    - Skill auto-invokes when user requests research extraction
    - 5-pass workflow: Claims/Evidence Pass 1-2, RDMAP Pass 1-2, Validation Pass 3
  2. Created automated workflow infrastructure
    - input/queue.yaml: Processing queue (1 paper ready: Sobotkova et al. 2023)
    - input/WORKFLOW.md: Complete workflow documentation
    - input/, outputs/: Folder structure for batch processing
    - Key decision: Using PDFs directly (not markdown) - fits in 200K context window
  3. Archived v2.5 development artifacts
    - Moved planning/to-do/, test reports, deployment guide to archive/extraction-development/v2.5/
    - Kept only current reference materials active
    - Committed and pushed (commit 320d7d1)
  4. Repository cleanup
    - Organized for sharing and FAIR4RS compliance
    - Clear separation: active vs. archived materials

  Current State - Ready for First Test Run

  Workflow structure:
  Input: PDF → output/{paper-slug}/extraction.json, validation-pass3.md, summary.md
  Prompts: extraction-system/prompts/{claims-evidence,rdmap}_pass{1,2}_prompt.md
  Schema: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json

  Test paper queued:
  - Path: sources/original-pdf/Sobotkova et al. - 2023 - Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from historical
   maps using novice volunteers.pdf
  - Slug: sobotkova-et-al-2023
  - Status: pending

  Token budget: ~70-85K per paper (well within 200K limit)

  IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Test the Workflow

  User wants to run the first automated extraction test.

  Invocation: "Process the next paper in the queue using the research-assessor workflow."

  Expected workflow:
  1. Read PDF from queue
  2. Load blank schema from extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json
  3. Run 5 passes (claims/evidence 1-2, RDMAP 1-2, validation)
  4. Write outputs to outputs/sobotkova-et-al-2023/
  5. Update queue status to completed

  Notes:
  - Skill will need restart to auto-invoke (or manually follow prompts)
  - Each pass appends to JSON (persistent state)
  - Pass 3 produces MD report only (no schema changes)
  - Final step: generate human-readable summary

  Key Files

  - Workflow doc: input/WORKFLOW.md
  - Queue: input/queue.yaml
  - Prompts: extraction-system/prompts/
  - Schema: extraction-system/schema/extraction_schema.json

  Ready to begin first v2.6 automated extraction test.
