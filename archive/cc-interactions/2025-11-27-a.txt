> Hi CC, welcome back, I've been away from this project for a week, can you 
review archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-17-d.txt and 2025-11-18-a.txt and 
help me recall where we left off, and what we need to do next? 

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-17-d.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1088 lines

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-18-a.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1203 lines

● Based on those session logs, here's where you left off:

  Summary of Last Sessions (Nov 17-18)

  Phase 7: Credibility Assessment System - Step 2 Complete

  You completed the Pass 8 classification prompt
  (assessment-system/prompts/classify-research-approach.md) with:
  - Two-stage classification (paper type → research approach)
  - Four paper types: empirical, methodological, theoretical, meta-research
  - HARKing detection, taxonomy feedback mechanism
  - 1,427 lines with 11-step workflow

  Documentation Updates Complete (Nov 18)

  Updated entire codebase from schema v2.5 → v2.6 and 7-pass → 8-pass
  workflow:
  - New Pass 6: Infrastructure Extraction (13 sections, FAIR scoring)
  - Old Pass 6 (Validation) renumbered to Pass 7
  - Commit 9538587

  Pre-commit Hook Created

  Enforces lowercase-with-hyphens filenames (you caught Claude slipping into
   ALL CAPS)

  ---
  What's Next

  Immediate blockers identified at session end:

  1. Create manifest file - version info currently only inline in READMEs
  2. Document extraction-launch.md - key workflow entry point but poorly
  documented

  Then continue to Step 3 (Classifier Testing):

  - Test classifier on 3 papers (3 runs each)
  - Blocker: ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 only has
  infrastructure-pass6-extraction.json - needs full extraction before
  classification testing
  - Other 2 papers ready: sobotkova-et-al-2024, penske-et-al-2023

  ---
  Would you like me to:
  1. Start with the manifest file and extraction-launch.md documentation?
  2. Jump straight to the ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 extraction?
  3. Check current queue.yaml status first?

> let's finish the documentation first, please create the manifest and 
extraction-launch.md. One question: what are your thoughts on stand-alone 
manifest files vs. incorporating them into all readmes where it makes sense 
to do so? 

● Good question - here are my thoughts:

  Standalone Manifest vs README-Integrated

  Standalone manifest file (e.g., manifest.yaml):

  | Pros                            | Cons                               |
  |---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | Single source of truth          | Another file to maintain           |
  | Machine-parseable (scripts, CI) | Can drift from documentation       |
  | Clear versioning for releases   | Less visible when browsing         |
  | Git tags can reference it       | Overkill for non-software projects |

  Integrated into READMEs:

  | Pros                               | Cons                             |
  |------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Visible where people actually look | Multiple places to update        |
  | Context-specific per component     | Risk of inconsistency            |
  | Human-friendly                     | Harder to parse programmatically |

  My Recommendation: Hybrid

  For this project specifically (research methodology, not software
  package), I'd suggest:

  1. Single manifest.yaml as source of truth - tracks schema version,
  workflow version, component versions, dates
  2. READMEs include version badges/headers that reference the manifest
  conceptually (human-readable summaries)
  3. CLAUDE.md references the manifest so I always know current versions

  This gives you:
  - One place to update versions (manifest)
  - Human context in READMEs where relevant
  - Machine-parseable if you ever want scripts to check versions
  - Clear audit trail

  The manifest doesn't need to be complex - just enough to track the key
  version numbers that currently live scattered across files.

  What's your preference? I can implement whichever approach suits your
  workflow best.

> I'll follow your recommendation, please proceed

● Good news - I can see ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 is now marked as
  completed in queue.yaml! That means we can proceed to classifier testing
  after this documentation work.

  I also spotted several version inconsistencies to fix. Let me create the
  manifest and clean everything up.

  Next step: Proceed to Step 3 - Classification testing on 3 papers
  (sobotkova-et-al-2024, ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018, penske-et-al-2023). All
   three now have complete extractions ready for testing.

recall we didn't, but we may have run one since

● Yes, we have a full extraction for ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018. It was
  completed on 2025-11-18:

  Extraction Summary:
  | Object Type        | Count |
  |--------------------|-------|
  | Evidence           | 22    |
  | Claims             | 53    |
  | Implicit arguments | 8     |
  | Research designs   | 2     |
  | Methods            | 2     |
  | Protocols          | 4     |
  | Implicit RDMAP     | 4     |
  | Total              | 95    |

  Plus it has reproducibility_infrastructure (Pass 6) and all standard keys.
   The queue.yaml shows it was completed with validation PASS and FAIR score
   35/40.

  All 3 test papers are ready for Step 3 classifier testing:
  - ✅ sobotkova-et-al-2024 (empirical/inductive expected)
  - ✅ ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 (methodological/software_tool expected)
  - ✅ penske-et-al-2023 (empirical/deductive expected)

  Would you like to proceed with the classification testing now?
