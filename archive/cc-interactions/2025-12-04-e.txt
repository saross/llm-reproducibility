● Variability Test Overview

  Aggregate Score Consistency

  | Paper                      | Type                | Mean Score | Range
     | SD  |
  |----------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------
  ---|-----|
  | sobotkova-et-al-2024       | Empirical/Deductive | 76.4       | 2
  (75-77)  | 0.9 |
  | penske-et-al-2023          | Empirical/Inductive | 76.6       | 4
  (74-78)  | 1.5 |
  | ballsun-stanton-et-al-2018 | Methodological      | 77.2       | 4
  (75-79)  | 1.5 |
  | ross-2005                  | Empirical/Abductive | 67.2       | 5
  (65-70)  | 2.2 |
  | sobotkova-et-al-2016       | Methodological      | 64.4       | 13 
  (55-68) | 5.2 |

  Key finding: Aggregate scores are remarkably stable across 4 of 5 papers
  (range 2-5 points). Paper 5 shows higher variability, with run-05 scoring
  55 vs 65-68 for others.

      |

  Key findings:
  - Implicit arguments are most stable - often identical across all 5 runs
  - Evidence and claims vary more - different runs identify different items
  - Methodological papers show higher count variability - more interpretive
  extraction

  adequate (5/5)      |
  | sobotkova-et-al-2016       | strong→moderate  | adequate→moderate |
  adequate→low        |

  Key finding: Cluster ratings remain consistent within papers except for
  sobotkova-et-al-2016, where run-05 rated lower across all clusters.

  Summary Observations

  High Consistency:
  1. Final verdicts stable - 24/25 runs produced same credibility band
  2. Implicit arguments highly reproducible - captures stable conceptual
  structure
  3. Cluster 2 (Evidential Strength) most consistent - objective factors

  Sources of Variability:
  1. Extraction granularity - same content chunked differently (1 vs 3
  evidence items)
  2. Protocol boundaries - what counts as distinct protocol varies
  3. Transparency scoring - most subjective signal, shows most variation

  Outlier Analysis:
  - sobotkova-et-al-2016 run-05 (score 55) diverged notably from runs 01-04
  (65-68)
  - This run applied stricter transparency criteria (undisclosed COI
  weighted more heavily)
  - Suggests assessor "mood" or emphasis can shift final scores by ~10
  points

  Bottom Line: The pipeline produces stable aggregate assessments (typically
   ±3 points) with more variation in extraction counts than final scores.
  The scoring aggregation absorbs extraction-level variability effectively.

> ok, can we re-run sobotkova 2016 run 05? VS Code crashed in the middle of 
the run and I re-started it, but since it is so anamolous, I think we ought 
to purge and re-run it 

● Absolutely - that makes sense. A crash mid-run could definitely cause
  anomalous results. Let me purge run-05 and reset the queue.

  To re-run, start a fresh session with /clear then run /variability-run.
  This ensures no context contamination from this session.
