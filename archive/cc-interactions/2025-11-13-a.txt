> great, thank you - for grant identifiers, both crossref and datacite are now offering DOIs for grants, and these are integrated with ORCID. we need
 to /compact now, but you might want to do a brief web search after compacting and add awareness of these identifiers, I expect them to become 
common. 

● I'll research the current state of grant DOIs from Crossref and DataCite, then update the PID Systems Guide accordingly.

● Web Search("Crossref grant DOIs ORCID integration 2024 2025")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 26s                                                                                                                            

● Web Search("DataCite grant DOIs funding identifiers")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 28s                                                                                                                            

● Web Search("grant DOI persistent identifier funding awards Crossref DataCite")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 27s                                                                                                                            

● Excellent! I found comprehensive information about grant DOIs. Let me read the current grant identifiers section and add this important update.

● Read(.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/pid-systems-guide.md)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines

● Read(.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/pid-systems-guide.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● Now I'll add the grant DOI information after the current grant identifiers section. Let me insert this important update.

● Update(.claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/pid-systems-guide.md)
  ⎿  Updated .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/infrastructure/pid-systems-guide.md with 95 additions                                   
       271    
       272    **Assessment note**: Record all grant numbers as `alternative_identifiers` in PID graph. Count as weak PID (contributes to context 
             but not to core PID connectivity score). Future: RAiD adoption will provide proper grant-level PIDs.
       273    
       274 +  #### Grant DOIs: Emerging Infrastructure (2024-2025+)
       275 +  
       276 +  **Status change**: Grant-level PIDs are now becoming available through both Crossref and DataCite, representing a significant 
           + advancement from the "future enhancement" stage noted above.
       277 +  
       278 +  **Two parallel systems:**
       279 +  
       280 +  ##### Crossref Grant Linking System (GLS)
       281 +  
       282 +  **Launch**: Active since 2019, expanded significantly 2024-2025
       283 +  
       284 +  **Scope**: Funders register as Crossref members to assign DOIs to grants, awards, prizes, facility access, and other forms of 
           + research support
       285 +  
       286 +  **Format**: Standard DOI structure (e.g., `10.13039/501100000923/grant-12345`)
       287 +  - Prefix identifies funder organisation
       288 +  - Suffix often incorporates existing grant number
       289 +  - Fully resolvable via DOI infrastructure
       290 +  
       291 +  **Benefits**:
       292 +  - Unique persistent identifier for each awarded grant
       293 +  - Open metadata distributed globally
       294 +  - Enables tracking of grant → outputs linkages at scale
       295 +  - Integrates with ORCID researcher profiles
       296 +  
       297 +  **Adoption examples**:
       298 +  - Multiple funding agencies joining as members (2024-2025)
       299 +  - Five-year milestone celebrated mid-2024
       300 +  - Enhanced metadata matching between publications and registered grants
       301 +  
       302 +  ##### DataCite Award DOIs
       303 +  
       304 +  **Launch**: Pilot programme 2023-2024, formal guidance published 2024
       305 +  
       306 +  **Scope**: Funders and institutions register DOIs for awards and grants using DataCite infrastructure
       307 +  
       308 +  **Format**: Standard DOI structure with award-specific metadata
       309 +  - University of California: 7,000+ grant DOIs registered via CDL (California Digital Library) pilot
       310 +  - Enables granular funding tracking at individual award level
       311 +  
       312 +  **Metadata schema**: DataCite Schema v4.0+ includes `FundingReference` property
       313 +  - `funderIdentifier`: ROR ID, Crossref Funder ID, GRID, ISNI, or other
       314 +  - `awardNumber`: Local grant identifier
       315 +  - `awardTitle`: Grant title
       316 +  
       317 +  **Benefits**:
       318 +  - Increased discoverability of awards
       319 +  - Traceability of outputs across systems
       320 +  - Richer open metadata for research impact assessment
       321 +  
       322 +  ##### ORCID Integration
       323 +  
       324 +  **Critical integration point**: Grant DOIs from both Crossref and DataCite integrate with ORCID researcher profiles
       325 +  
       326 +  **Functionality**:
       327 +  - Researchers can add funded grants to ORCID records
       328 +  - Publications linked to grants automatically via ORCID auto-update
       329 +  - Creates persistent graph: Funder → Grant DOI → ORCID → Publication DOI → Data DOI
       330 +  
       331 +  **Impact on PID graph connectivity**: When grant DOIs present in papers:
       332 +  - PID connectivity score increases (adds persistent funding link)
       333 +  - Enables automated funder reporting
       334 +  - Improves FAIR F1, A1 scores (grants become persistently identifiable and accessible)
       335 +  
       336 +  ##### Extraction Protocol for Grant DOIs
       337 +  
       338 +  **If grant DOI present in paper:**
       339 +  
       340 +  ```json
       341 +  {
       342 +    "funding": [
       343 +      {
       344 +        "agency": "European Research Council",
       345 +        "grant_number": "834616",
       346 +        "grant_doi": "10.13039/501100000781/ERC-2019-CoG-834616",
       347 +        "grant_doi_type": "crossref_gls",
       348 +        "scheme": "Consolidator Grant",
       349 +        "amount": null,
       350 +        "period": "2020-2025"
       351 +      }
       352 +    ]
       353 +  }
       354 +  ```
       355 +  
       356 +  **Expected adoption timeline**:
       357 +  - **2024-2025**: Early adopters (UC system, select European funders)
       358 +  - **2026-2028**: Increasing adoption as funder mandates expand
       359 +  - **2029+**: Likely to become common practice, especially for major research funders
       360 +  
       361 +  **Assessment implications**:
       362 +  - **Pre-2024 papers**: Grant DOIs unlikely to be present (infrastructure nascent)
       363 +  - **2024-2025 papers**: Grant DOIs indicate cutting-edge funder compliance
       364 +  - **2026+ papers**: Grant DOIs may become expected for well-funded research
       365 +  - **FAIR scoring impact**: Grant DOIs strengthen F1 (unique identifier) and A1 (persistent access to grant metadata), improving 
           + overall PID connectivity
       366 +  
       367 +  **Current status (2025)**: Grant DOIs are **emerging but not yet widespread**. Absence should not be penalised; presence indicates 
           + exemplary practice.
       368 +

       371    ### 4. IGSN (International Generic Sample Number)

● Perfect! I've successfully updated the PID Systems Guide with comprehensive information about grant DOIs. Here's what I added:

  Grant DOIs: Emerging Infrastructure (2024-2025+)

  Added new subsection after line 272 documenting:

  Two Parallel Systems

  1. Crossref Grant Linking System (GLS)
  - Active since 2019, expanded 2024-2025
  - Funders register as Crossref members to assign DOIs to grants/awards
  - Standard DOI format incorporating funder prefix + grant number
  - Five-year milestone celebrated mid-2024

  2. DataCite Award DOIs
  - Pilot programme 2023-2024
  - University of California registered 7,000+ grant DOIs via CDL
  - Uses DataCite Schema v4.0+ FundingReference property
  - Enables granular award-level tracking

  ORCID Integration (Key Finding)

  Both systems integrate with ORCID, creating persistent graph:
  Funder → Grant DOI → ORCID → Publication DOI → Data DOI

  This addresses your point about ORCID integration directly.

  Practical Guidance Added

  - Extraction protocol with JSON example showing grant_doi and grant_doi_type fields
  - Adoption timeline: Early adopters (2024-2025) → Increasing adoption (2026-2028) → Common practice (2029+)
  - Assessment implications: Pre-2024 papers won't have grant DOIs, 2026+ may be expected
  - FAIR scoring impact: Grant DOIs strengthen F1 and A1, improve PID connectivity

  Current Status

  Documented as emerging but not yet widespread (2025) - absence shouldn't be penalised, presence indicates exemplary practice.

  The update integrates seamlessly with the existing content, noting this represents "significant advancement from the 'future enhancement' stage"
  mentioned earlier in the guide. Total addition: ~95 lines covering both systems comprehensively.

> ok, great - what was next on our to-do list? 

● Let me check the active to-do list to see what's next.

● Read(planning/active-todo-list.md)
  ⎿  Read 712 lines

● Based on the active to-do list, we've just completed:
  - ✅ Section 5b Phase 2 immediate actions (guidance updates for infrastructure assessment)
  - ✅ Grant DOI research and update

  Next up is Section 1: Repository Documentation (High Priority - 4-6 hours estimated)

  The three main tasks are:

  1. Main README Improvements (1-2 hours)
    - Clear project overview and purpose
    - Quick start guide
    - Repository structure explanation
    - Links to key documentation
    - Citation, licence, contribution guidelines
  2. Subdirectory README Files (2-3 hours)
    - extraction-system/README.md
    - outputs/README.md
    - archive/README.md
    - planning/README.md
    - reports/README.md
    - scripts/README.md
  3. Documentation Index (1 hour)
    - Create docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
    - Map all documentation
    - Guide for different user types

  The overall focus is "Documentation, code quality, and FAIR4RS compliance before expanding to new papers", so we're working through the
  high-priority documentation foundation before doing more extractions.

  Would you like to start with the main README improvements, or would you prefer to tackle a different section from the to-do list?

> ok, great, now is a good time for housekeeping and documentation. First, could you please review planning and other docs that are still 'active' 
(i.e., not in archive/) and see if any are finished / outdated / superceded so that they can be moved to an appropriate folder in /archive? Show me 
your list of candidates before archiving them 

● I'll review the planning and docs directories to identify candidates for archiving.

  Summary

  High confidence archives: 4 items (migration-log, preliminary-work folder, reproducibility-infrastructure-schema, entire skill-documentation
  folder)

  Clarification needed: 1 item (extraction-to-analysis-transition.md - still active planning?)

  Total files to move: ~15 files across 4-5 items

  Should I proceed with archiving the high-confidence items, or would you like to review the extraction-to-analysis-transition.md document first to
  decide its fate?

> I'd like to keep 'planning/extraction-to-analysis-transition.md' ACTIVE for now, do not archive. Otherwise, please proceed with archiving 

● I'll proceed with archiving the high-confidence items now.

● Archiving complete! Here's what was moved:

  Successfully Archived

  Planning Documents → archive/planning-completed/

  1. ✅ migration-log.md - Schema v2.5 field name migration audit trail
  2. ✅ preliminary-work/ folder - Pre-project proposals (CLAIMS, CWTS)
  3. ✅ reproducibility-infrastructure-schema.md - Pass 6 planning document (now implemented)

  Documentation → archive/documentation-archive/

  4. ✅ skill-documentation/ folder - 10 files of skill development documentation

  Current State

  Planning directory (9 items remaining):
  - ✅ extraction-to-analysis-transition.md (kept active as requested)
  - Active planning docs: fellowship/, active-todo-list, rubrics, findings, analyses
  - Quick script: quick_infrastructure_scan.py

  Docs directory (4 items):
  - background-research/
  - schema/
  - user-guide/
  - README.md

  ARCHIVE_INDEX.md updated with:
  - New section "Archived: 2025-11-13 (Pass 6 Implementation Complete)"
  - Documentation of all archived items with rationale
  - Updated archive structure diagram

  All archived items remain in git history and can be retrieved if needed. The repository structure is now cleaner for the documentation phase ahead.

> ok, it's also been a while since we reviewed documentation, and I believe we identified updating documentation as a priority, could you make a plan
 to update all of the readmes and other docs, including development of skill documentation (which must not go into the skill itself in .claude/, but 
should sit elsewhere, as per best practice, see the skill-creator skill if necessary). We'll want to also document the extraction workflow so far, 
and make sure we still have all of the necessary information to be FAIR4RS compliant (and that its content is updated). As before, when creating 
files avoid ALL CAPS unless strongly indicated by convention (I see 'ARCHIVE_INDEX.md' is all caps, and I'm not sure about that) 

● I'll review the current documentation state and create a comprehensive plan. Let me start by checking the skill-creator guidance and examining what
   we have.

● Based on my comprehensive research, I need to ask you a few key questions before finalizing the documentation update plan:
                                                                                                                                                    
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Where should user-facing documentation for the research-assessor skill be located? → I'd prefer alignment with skill-creator best practice, 
     BUT my understanding was that user-facing documentation was NOT supposed to go in the .claude/skills/[skill-name]/ folder - has that advice 
     changed?
     · What should we do about the missing examples/ directory that's referenced in multiple places? → Create examples/ with sample extractions
     · How should we describe the current version now that we're beyond v2.5 with Pass 6 infrastructure added? → v2.6 (incremental from v2.5)
     · Who is the primary audience for documentation? → Researchers using the tool

● Good question! Let me clarify the skill-creator best practice:

  You're absolutely correct - user-facing documentation should NOT go in .claude/skills/research-assessor/. The skill-creator guidance distinguishes:

  - In .claude/skills/skill-name/: SKILL.md + references/ (documentation for Claude to load into context while working)
  - Outside the skill (e.g., in docs/): User-facing documentation for humans to read and learn from

  So the right approach is Option A: Create docs/research-assessor-guide/ for comprehensive user-facing documentation, while
  .claude/skills/research-assessor/ remains focused on what Claude needs to execute the skill.

  Now I'll present the complete plan with your clarifications:

● Phase 1 Complete! ✅

  I've successfully completed all Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) tasks:

  1. ✅ Updated main README.md - v2.6, 7-pass workflow, all refs fixed
  2. ✅ Created extraction-system/README.md - comprehensive system overview
  3. ✅ Created outputs/README.md - complete outputs documentation
  4. ✅ Renamed archive-index.md - now follows lowercase convention

  Phase 1 Progress: 4/4 tasks complete

  Now continuing with Phase 2 (User Guide Updates). This is a larger effort - I'll start with the extraction workflow documentation which needs
  substantial updates for the 7-pass workflow.

> let's /compact before you continue - can you create a compact message for smooth transition to the next session? 

● Perfect timing for a compact! Here's a summary message:

  ---
  Documentation Update v2.6 - Session Summary

  Completed: Phase 1 - Critical Fixes ✅

  All 4 tasks complete:
  1. ✅ Updated main README.md - v2.6, 7-pass workflow, fixed all archived skill-documentation/ references → docs/research-assessor-guide/
  2. ✅ Created extraction-system/README.md - comprehensive overview of extraction toolkit
  3. ✅ Created outputs/README.md - complete guide to extraction outputs and usage
  4. ✅ Renamed ARCHIVE_INDEX.md → archive-index.md (lowercase-with-hyphens convention)

  Next: Phase 2 - User Guide Updates (13 remaining tasks)

  Immediate priorities:
  - Update docs/user-guide/extraction-workflow.md (5-pass → 7-pass, add Pass 0 and Pass 6)
  - Update docs/user-guide/getting-started.md (fix archived refs, 7-pass workflow)
  - Update docs/user-guide/schema-reference.md (v2.4 → v2.6)
  - Update docs/README.md (fix refs, update to 7-pass)

  Then: Phase 3 (Skill docs), Phase 4 (FAIR4RS), Phase 5 (examples/), Phase 6 (additional READMEs), Phase 7 (global cleanup)

  Key Decisions Made

  User preferences confirmed:
  - Skill documentation location: docs/research-assessor-guide/ (NOT in .claude/skills/)
  - Create examples/ directory with sample extractions
  - Version: v2.6 (incremental from v2.5)
  - Primary audience: Researchers using the tool

  Current workflow: 7 passes (0-6) + validation (Pass 7):
  - Pass 0: Metadata
  - Pass 1-2: Claims/Evidence
  - Pass 3-5: RDMAP (explicit, implicit, rationalization)
  - Pass 6: Infrastructure (PIDs, FAIR, funding, permits)
  - Pass 7: Validation

  Todo List Status

  17 tasks total: 4 complete, 13 pending

  Next task queued: Update docs/user-guide/extraction-workflow.md (estimated 2 hours - substantial rewrite for 7-pass workflow)

  Files modified this session:
  - README.md (v2.6 updates)
  - extraction-system/README.md (new)
  - outputs/README.md (new)
  - archive/archive-index.md (renamed)
  - archive/archive-index.md (content updated with 2025-11-13 archive entries)

  Ready to continue with Phase 2 user guide updates.
