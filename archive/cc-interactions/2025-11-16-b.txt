> /compact   Session Recovery: Credibility Assessment Planning Complete ✅

  What We Accomplished

  Recovered from VS Code crash and completed comprehensive planning for 
individual paper credibility assessment system.

  3 planning documents created (43KB):
  1. paper-credibility-analysis-framework.md (24KB) - All 17 design questions 
answered
  2. research-approach-classification-framework.md (16KB) - Complete 
classification spec
  3. credibility-assessment-implementation-roadmap.md (13KB) - 5-phase plan 
(17-24 hours)

  Key Design Decisions ✅

  - Target: Individual papers (not corpus)
  - Architecture: One prompt per discrete task (7 signals + classifier + quality
 assessment = ~9-10 prompts)
  - Classification: Expressed vs revealed approach with HARKing detection (after
 extraction, Pass 6.5/7)
  - Assessment: All 7 repliCATS signals, approach-specific emphasis, narrative 
importance
  - Quality: Track A (extraction) + Track B (credibility) parallel with reducing
 overhead
  - Skills: Extend research-assessor, use skill-creator for prompt/skill 
boundaries
  - Testing: Start with 3 papers (sobotkova-2024, ballsun-stanton-2018, 
penske-2023), expand to all 10

  Critical Architectural Principle

  "Discrete tasks = separate prompts; interacting tasks = same prompt"

  Next Session: Final Planning Before Implementation

  MUST DO FIRST: Create overall implementation plan with:
  - Prompt architecture diagram (which prompts, execution order, data flow)
  - Skill extension design (what goes in research-assessor vs prompts)
  - File structure for outputs (classification.json, assessments/, reports/)
  - Validation checkpoints per component

  THEN: Begin Phase 1 (build classifier, test on 3 papers)

  Files to Review Next Session

  - planning/credibility-assessment-implementation-roadmap.md (5-phase plan)
  - planning/paper-credibility-analysis-framework.md (all decisions)
  - planning/research-approach-classification-framework.md (classification spec)

> I believe we are ready to Create overall implementation plan we discussed 
last session; I think I've answered all of your questions, but please do ask
 if I have not. Otherwise, if you have the guideance and information you 
need, please create the plan. 

● I'll create the comprehensive implementation plan we discussed. Let me
  start by using the skill-creator skill to help determine the boundaries
  between prompts and skills, then build the complete plan.

> The "skill-creator" skill is running 

● Now let me examine the current research-assessor skill to understand its
  structure and determine the optimal boundaries for our credibility
  assessment implementation.

● Read(.claude/skills/research-assessor/SKILL.md)
  ⎿  Read 224 lines

● Now let me check the existing assessment-system directory structure to
  understand what's already in place:

● Bash(find assessment-system -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.py" | head -20)

● Perfect! I've created the comprehensive implementation plan. Let me
  provide you with a concise summary of what's in this document:

  Implementation Plan Complete ✅

  I've created planning/credibility-implementation-plan-detailed.md (25KB)
  covering all requested elements:

  Key Components

  1. Prompt vs Skill Boundary Analysis
  - Following research-assessor architecture: skills = stable frameworks,
  prompts = evolving instructions
  - Recommendation: Extend research-assessor skill (not create new one)
  - Add 7 reference files to
  .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/credibility/
  - Add 2 schema files for classification and assessment structures

  2. Prompt Architecture (10 Prompts)
  - PROMPT 1: classify-research-approach.md (sequential dependency)
  - PROMPTS 2-9: track-a + 7 signals (parallel execution possible)
  - PROMPT 10: generate-credibility-report.md (waits for all inputs)
  - Clear ASCII diagram showing data flow and dependencies

  3. Skill Extension Design
  - Update SKILL.md description to include credibility assessment
  - Add Pass 8 (Classification) and Pass 9 (Assessment) to workflow
  - 7 new reference files specified with content structure
  - 2 schema files for structured outputs

  4. File Structure Specification
  outputs/{paper-slug}/assessment/
  ├── classification.json
  ├── track-a-quality.md
  ├── signals/
  │   ├── 01-comprehensibility.md
  │   ├── 02-transparency.md
  │   └── ... (7 total)
  └── credibility-report-v1.md

  5. Data Flow & Dependencies
  - Complete input requirements per prompt
  - Skill reference usage mapped
  - Sequential vs parallel execution clearly defined

  6. Validation Checkpoints (6 Checkpoints)
  - Checkpoint 1: Classifier working (3 papers)
  - Checkpoint 2: First rubric working (transparency)
  - Checkpoint 3: End-to-end proof of concept
  - Checkpoint 4: All seven signals working
  - Checkpoint 5: Complete report generated
  - Checkpoint 6: Corpus testing (all 10 papers)

  Each checkpoint includes validation criteria, commands, and manual review
  guidance.

  7. Phase 1 Implementation Sequence (6-7 hours)
  - Step 1: Extend research-assessor skill (2h)
  - Step 2: Create classification prompt (1h)
  - Step 3: Test classifier on 3 papers (1h)
  - Step 4: Create transparency rubric (1h)
  - Step 5: End-to-end proof of concept (1-2h)

  Architecture Highlights

  Following skill-creator guidance:
  - Skills store stable knowledge (taxonomies, frameworks, schemas)
  - Prompts contain evolving task instructions
  - Enables iteration without skill versioning conflicts

  Critical design principle applied:
  "Discrete tasks = separate prompts; interacting tasks = same prompt"

  Ready to Proceed?

  The plan is complete and implementation-ready. Would you like me to:
  1. Begin Phase 1 Step 1 (extend research-assessor skill)?
  2. Review any specific section of the plan first?
  3. Make adjustments to the plan?

  All design decisions from the previous session are incorporated, and the
  plan follows the research-assessor architecture pattern you've
  established.

> To me, your plan looks good. If I asked you to take the roll of a critical
 friend and review it with an eye towards weaknesses or opportunities for 
improvement, what would you critique be? It's a complex plan and I'd like 
you to put on a different hat and review it, then we will synthesise your 
critique. If you think it would help, I could also ask another LLM (Gemini 
Pro 2.5 or ChatGPT5), let me know if you'd like me to do that. 

● Excellent idea. Let me put on my critical friend hat and examine this plan
   rigorously. I'll look for gaps, risks, over-complexity,
  under-specification, and missed opportunities.

  Critical Review of Implementation Plan

  Major Concerns

  1. Prompt Proliferation Risk (10 prompts)

  Critique: 10 separate prompts may create maintenance burden and
  coordination complexity.

  Specific issues:
  - Each prompt needs independent testing, versioning, refinement
  - Changes to output format require updating multiple prompts
  - Risk of inconsistency across 7 signal assessment prompts
  - Cognitive load for understanding system: need to know which prompt does
  what

  Alternative not explored:
  - Could we consolidate the 7 signal assessments into 1-3 prompts?
  - Example: "assess-credibility-signals.md" that handles all 7 in one pass
  with clear subsections
  - Trade-off: Lose modularity, but gain consistency and maintainability

  Question: Is the "discrete tasks = separate prompts" heuristic too
  strictly applied here? The 7 signals all:
  - Use same inputs (extraction.json, classification.json)
  - Follow same structure (score, justification, evidence)
  - Could inform each other (transparency relates to replicability)

  Recommendation: Consider 2-3 consolidated prompts instead of 7:
  - Prompt A: Core signals (Comprehensibility, Transparency, Validity) - 3
  signals that apply universally
  - Prompt B: Methodological signals (Plausibility, Robustness,
  Replicability) - 3 signals more approach-specific
  - Prompt C: Scope signal (Generalisability) - 1 signal that synthesises
  others

  Or even: Single "assess-seven-signals.md" prompt with clear instructions
  to assess each independently but allow cross-referencing.

  ---
  2. Skill Extension vs New Skill Decision Under-Justified

  Critique: Plan recommends extending research-assessor skill, but doesn't
  rigorously compare to creating separate "credibility-assessor" skill.

  Arguments for separation (not addressed):
  - research-assessor is already complex (Pass 0-7)
  - Adding Passes 8-9 increases cognitive load
  - Credibility assessment is conceptually distinct from extraction
  - Users might want extraction without assessment, or vice versa
  - Separate skills = clearer boundaries, easier to version independently

  Arguments for extension (stated but thin):
  - "Builds directly on extraction" - but so would a separate skill
  - "Shares infrastructure" - but references can be shared across skills
  - "Maintains single coherent workflow" - but workflow could span 2 skills

  Missing analysis:
  - How often will users want extraction-only vs full assessment?
  - Does bundling everything in one skill violate single responsibility
  principle?
  - Will skill description become unwieldy ("does extraction AND
  assessment")?

  Recommendation: Either:
  1. Strengthen justification for single-skill approach with clearer
  reasoning
  2. Reconsider creating separate "credibility-assessor" skill that depends
  on research-assessor

  ---
  3. Validation Strategy Lacks Quantitative Baselines

  Critique: All 6 checkpoints rely on manual review with subjective criteria
   like "makes sense" and "feels right".

  Missing elements:
  - Inter-rater reliability: No plan to compare Claude's assessments to
  human expert judgments
  - Test-retest reliability: No plan to run same assessment multiple times
  to check consistency
  - Convergent validity: No plan to correlate signal scores with existing
  metrics (we have 8 metrics already!)
  - Known-groups validity: No explicit selection of papers that should score
   high vs low
  - Quantitative thresholds: "Score discriminating appropriately" - what
  does this mean numerically?

  Specific gaps:
  - Checkpoint 1: "Classifications make sense" - to whom? Based on what
  standard?
  - Checkpoint 2: "Score feels right" - compared to what baseline?
  - Checkpoint 4: "Scores discriminate (not all 70-80)" - what's acceptable
  variance? SD > 15?

  Recommendation: Add quantitative validation:
  - Run 3x on same paper (different Claude invocations) → measure score
  variance
  - Compare to existing metrics: Do high TCI papers also get high
  Transparency signal scores? (Should correlate ~0.6-0.8)
  - Expert validation sample: Get 1-2 expert assessments on pilot papers to
  compare
  - Define acceptable ranges: "Good discrimination = SD > 20 across corpus"

  ---
  4. No Error Handling or Failure Mode Planning

  Critique: Plan assumes everything works. No consideration of:

  What if scenarios:
  - Classification yields "low confidence" - then what?
  - Signal assessment can't find relevant evidence - how to handle?
  - Expressed vs revealed comparison is ambiguous - flag for human review?
  - Extraction quality is too low to assess credibility - abort workflow?
  - LLM refuses to score or gives scores outside 0-100 range

  Missing:
  - Confidence thresholds: At what confidence level do we flag for human
  review?
  - Graceful degradation: Can we generate partial reports if some signals
  fail?
  - Quality gates: Should we check Track A quality BEFORE running Track B
  assessments?
  - Iterative refinement protocol: What's the process when a checkpoint
  fails?

  Example not addressed:
  If sobotkova-et-al-2024 classification returns:
  expressed_approach: "none_stated"
  revealed_approach: "mixed"
  revealed_confidence: "low"
  Should we proceed with assessment? Or flag as "needs human review"?

  Recommendation:
  - Add confidence thresholds per checkpoint (e.g., "classification
  confidence < medium → flag for review")
  - Define fallback procedures (e.g., "if signal assessment finds no
  evidence → score = N/A, note in report")
  - Create error taxonomy and handling guide

  ---
  5. Track A Integration Underspecified

  Critique: Track A (quality monitoring) is mentioned but integration is
  vague.

  Unclear:
  - When does Track A run? Prompt 2 suggests after classification, but
  shouldn't it inform whether to proceed?
  - What happens if Track A identifies major quality issues? Do we abort
  credibility assessment?
  - Is Track A output used to qualify credibility report? E.g., "Note:
  Extraction confidence = Medium, scores may be less reliable"
  - How does Track A feed back to extraction improvement? Is this a manual
  process or automated?

  Current plan shows Track A as parallel to Track B, but they should 
  interact:
  Track A (Quality Check)
          ↓
     [Decision Gate]
          ↓
     High quality → Proceed to Track B
     Medium quality → Proceed with caveat
     Low quality → Flag for re-extraction

  Recommendation:
  - Make Track A a pre-assessment gate not just parallel documentation
  - Define quality thresholds that trigger different pathways
  - Integrate Track A findings into credibility report prominently
  - Create feedback loop: Track A findings → extraction refinement queue

  ---
  6. Approach-Specific Assessment Mechanics Unclear

  Critique: Plan states "apply approach-specific emphasis" but doesn't
  specify HOW this works mechanically.

  Questions:
  - Do all 7 signals get assessed regardless of approach, with different
  weighting in final report?
  - Or do some signals get skipped based on approach? (Plan says "assess all
   seven" but also "deemphasised signals")
  - How is "emphasis" applied? In scoring? In report length? In
  recommendation priority?

  Example ambiguity:
  For inductive paper:
  - PRIMARY signals: Transparency, Comprehensibility, Generalisability
  - SECONDARY signals: Validity, Robustness
  - DEEMPHASISED signals: Replicability (?)

  Does "deemphasised" mean:
  - A) Assess but mention briefly in report?
  - B) Assess but weight lower in overall judgment?
  - C) Assess with different rubric (e.g., "analytic reproducibility" not
  "field replication")?

  Recommendation:
  - Clarify assessment mechanics: all 7 assessed with same rigour, emphasis
  is narrative/interpretive
  - OR: Define approach-specific rubric variations (Replicability-Inductive
  vs Replicability-Deductive)
  - OR: Define signal subsets per approach (Inductive: assess 5/7 signals,
  mark 2 as N/A)

  Current plan doesn't make this decision explicit.

  ---
  7. Testing Sequence Too Linear

  Critique: Phase 1 tests on 3 papers sequentially, but doesn't leverage
  diversity efficiently.

  Current sequence:
  1. Build classifier
  2. Test on sobotkova-2024, ballsun-stanton-2018, penske-2023
  3. Build transparency rubric
  4. Test transparency on sobotkova-2024 only
  5. Build remaining rubrics

  Problem: Transparency tested on only 1 paper before building other 6
  rubrics.

  Risk: Transparency rubric might be overfitted to sobotkova-2024
  characteristics. When we test on other papers, rubric might fail,
  requiring rework of ALL rubrics simultaneously.

  Better sequence:
  1. Build classifier
  2. Test on 3 papers
  3. Build transparency rubric
  4. Test transparency on all 3 papers (not just sobotkova) ← CRITICAL
  5. Refine transparency rubric based on 3-paper diversity
  6. Build remaining 6 rubrics (learning from transparency refinement)

  Recommendation:
  - Test each component on multiple papers before proceeding
  - Use 3-paper test set consistently throughout Phase 1
  - "Fail fast" on diversity before committing to full rubric set

  ---
  8. RepliCATS Validation Deferred Too Long

  Critique: Plan says "build complete tool on 10-11 papers first, then
  validate on repliCATS corpus" (Phase 5+).

  Risk: By Phase 5, we've built entire system. If repliCATS comparison
  reveals fundamental incompatibility, massive rework required.

  Better approach:
  - Early repliCATS pilot: After Phase 1 (classifier + transparency
  working), find 1-2 papers in repliCATS corpus that we can access
  - Test classification and 1 signal assessment
  - Compare our scores to repliCATS human panel scores
  - Validate approach BEFORE building all 7 rubrics

  Missing from plan:
  - How accessible is repliCATS corpus? Do we have it now?
  - Can we get 2-3 sample papers with expert scores for early validation?
  - What's acceptable correlation for "validates our approach"? (r > 0.6?
  0.7?)

  Recommendation:
  - Insert "Phase 1.5: Early repliCATS pilot" (1-2 hours)
  - Test classifier + transparency on 1-2 repliCATS papers
  - Check if our approach produces comparable results
  - Refine before building remaining 6 rubrics

  ---
  9. File Format Decision Not Justified

  Critique: Plan specifies "classification.json (YAML format in JSON file)"
  but doesn't justify format choice.

  Questions:
  - Why YAML in .json file? Why not .yaml file?
  - Why not pure JSON (consistent with extraction.json)?
  - Signal assessments are .md files - why not .json for structured data?

  Consistency issue:
  - extraction.json = JSON
  - classification.json = YAML in JSON wrapper (?)
  - signals/*.md = Markdown
  - credibility-report.md = Markdown

  Missing trade-off analysis:
  - Markdown signals: Human-readable, but harder to parse for corpus
  analysis
  - JSON signals: Machine-readable, but less browsable
  - Mixed formats: Flexible, but inconsistent

  Recommendation:
  - Justify format choices explicitly (readability vs parseability
  trade-offs)
  - OR: Standardise on JSON for all structured data, generate Markdown
  reports from JSON
  - OR: Accept mixed formats but document reasoning (classification = JSON
  for parsing, reports = MD for reading)

  ---
  10. Scope Creep Risk in Report Generation

  Critique: Credibility report spec is ambitious (3-5 pages, 7 signals,
  recommendations, synthesis) but no guidance on how to keep it bounded.

  Risk: Report generation prompt might produce:
  - 10-page reports (exceeds 3-5 page target)
  - Overly detailed signal summaries (redundant with individual signal .md
  files)
  - Generic recommendations (not actionable)

  Missing:
  - Word count targets per section (e.g., "Each signal summary: 150-200
  words MAX")
  - Redundancy prevention: Report should synthesise, not duplicate signal
  .md files
  - Recommendation quality criteria: What makes a recommendation
  "actionable"?

  Recommendation:
  - Add explicit constraints to generate-credibility-report.md prompt:
    - "Total report: 1500-2500 words"
    - "Each signal: 2-3 sentences synthesis (not full copy from signal
  file)"
    - "Recommendations: 5-7 items, each <50 words, specific to this paper"
  - Include example report structure with word counts

  ---
  Medium Concerns

  11. Prompt Template Provided, But Incomplete

  Critique: Plan shows prompt structure examples but they're sketches, not
  full templates.

  Example: "assess-transparency.md" structure shown (lines 450-480), but
  missing:
  - How to cite extraction elements in justification
  - How to handle missing evidence (no protocols extracted → impacts
  transparency score how?)
  - How to calibrate confidence (what makes confidence "high" vs "medium"?)
  - Example output with specific paper content

  Risk: When implementing, we'll need to flesh out these templates
  significantly, adding 2-3 hours to Phase 1 estimates.

  Recommendation:
  - Either: Accept estimates might expand 20-30%
  - Or: Create one COMPLETE prompt template (transparency) with all details,
   use as model for others

  ---
  12. Parallel Execution Not Tested

  Critique: Plan assumes Prompts 3-9 can run in parallel, but doesn't
  consider:

  - Context window limits: Can 7 signal assessment prompts + all inputs fit
  in context simultaneously?
  - API rate limits: If we invoke 7 prompts concurrently, do we hit rate
  limits?
  - Cognitive load: Is it better to assess signals sequentially, allowing
  each to inform the next?

  Current architecture assumes independence, but signals might interact:
  - Transparency assessment findings might inform Replicability assessment
  - Validity concerns might surface issues relevant to Robustness
  - Comprehensibility problems might explain low scores on other signals

  Recommendation:
  - Test parallel vs sequential execution in Phase 1
  - Consider "signal assessment batches":
    - Batch 1: Comprehensibility, Transparency (foundational)
    - Batch 2: Validity, Plausibility, Robustness (informed by Batch 1)
    - Batch 3: Replicability, Generalisability (synthesise prior
  assessments)

  ---
  13. No Plan for Prompt Versioning

  Critique: Plan emphasizes "prompts evolve through testing" but no
  versioning strategy.

  Questions:
  - Do we version prompts? (assess-transparency-v1.md, v2.md?)
  - Do we track which prompt version generated which assessment?
  - How do we handle corpus consistency when prompts change mid-corpus?

  Example scenario:
  - Assess papers 1-3 with transparency-v1.md
  - Refine prompt based on results → transparency-v2.md
  - Assess papers 4-10 with transparency-v2.md
  - Now we have inconsistent assessments across corpus

  Options not evaluated:
  - A) Lock prompt versions until full corpus complete (prevents
  improvement)
  - B) Version prompts, re-assess earlier papers when prompt improves
  (time-consuming)
  - C) Document prompt evolution, accept inconsistency, note in corpus
  analysis (pragmatic)

  Recommendation:
  - Choose versioning strategy explicitly
  - For 10-paper corpus: Option C (document evolution, accept small
  inconsistencies)
  - For larger corpus: Option B (re-assess with refined prompts)

  ---
  Minor Concerns

  14. Success Criteria Vague in Places

  Examples:
  - "Classifications make sense" - to whom? Expert? User? Claude?
  - "Actionable recommendations" - actionable by whom? Paper authors? Future
   researchers?
  - "Cross-signal consistency" - no contradictions, or actively coherent?

  15. No User Testing Consideration

  - You (Shawn) will be primary user
  - Plan doesn't include "user review" checkpoints
  - Should Phase 1 end with "Shawn reviews classifier + transparency
  outputs, provides feedback"?

  16. Metrics Integration Underspecified

  - We have 8 metrics from Phase 6
  - Plan mentions using them in assessment but doesn't detail how
  - Do metrics inform signal scores? Or just appear in scorecard table?
  - Should high ESD correlate with high Evidence density signal?

  ---
  Summary of Critical Friend Feedback

  Top 5 Recommendations

  1. Reconsider 7 separate signal prompts → Consolidate to 2-3 or even 1
  comprehensive prompt
  2. Add quantitative validation → Test-retest reliability, metric
  correlation, defined variance thresholds
  3. Make Track A a pre-assessment gate → Don't assess credibility if
  extraction quality is too low
  4. Test transparency on 3 papers before proceeding → Prevent overfitting
  to single paper
  5. Insert early repliCATS validation → Validate approach after Phase 1,
  before building all rubrics

  Overall Assessment

  Strengths:
  - Comprehensive and well-structured
  - Clear data flow and dependencies
  - Validation checkpoints included
  - Implementation sequence logical

  Weaknesses:
  - Over-reliance on manual validation (needs quantitative baselines)
  - Prompt proliferation risk (10 prompts may be too many)
  - Error handling and failure modes not addressed
  - Testing sequence too linear (needs more diversity earlier)

  Grade: B+ (Very good, but could be A with revisions addressing top 5
  recommendations)

  On External Review

  Do you want Gemini 2.5 or ChatGPT-4o review?

  My recommendation: Yes, get 1 external review (Gemini 2.5 preferred if it
  has large context window).

  Why:
  - I may have blindspots from creating the plan
  - External LLM might catch architectural issues I'm missing
  - Different training might surface HASS-domain considerations I'm not
  aware of

  What to ask external reviewer:
  1. Review this implementation plan for credibility assessment
  2. Focus on: architectural soundness, HASS research appropriateness,
  repliCATS compatibility
  3. Identify risks, gaps, over-complexity
  4. Suggest 3-5 highest-priority improvements

  Then we synthesise: Your review + my critique + external review → refined
  plan.

  What do you think? Should I wait for your synthesis of my critique, or
  shall we get external input first?

> Ok, I will ask another LLM for a critique - but I need to provide context 
for the cridibility-implementation-plan-detailed.md document - could you 
compose that context? You'll have a better idea than I do what background 
information is crucial for an LLM

     # Context for External Review of Credibility Assessment Implementation
     Plan

     ## What We're Asking You to Review

     … +313 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive context document for the external
  reviewer. Here's what I included:

  Context Document Structure

  1. Clear Task Definition
  - What we're asking for (critique focus areas)
  - Output format requested

  2. Project Background
  - What we've built (Phases 1-6 extraction + metrics)
  - What we're building next (credibility assessment)

  3. Domain Context (CRITICAL for external reviewer)
  - HASS research characteristics (why it's different from experimental
  science)
  - RepliCATS framework explanation (external validation standard)
  - Required HASS adaptations (analytic reproducibility, CARE principles,
  etc.)

  4. Our Design Decisions
  - 7 fundamental choices we've made
  - Key architectural principle ("discrete tasks = separate prompts")

  5. Implementation Plan Overview
  - 10-prompt architecture summary
  - File structure
  - Estimated effort

  6. Critical Questions to Address
  - 6 specific areas where we want external perspective:
    a. Prompt architecture (10 prompts optimal?)
    b. Skill extension decision (extend vs create new?)
    c. Validation strategy (manual sufficient?)
    d. Approach-specific mechanics (how does it work?)
    e. Track A integration (gate vs parallel?)
    f. Complexity vs value (right balance?)

  7. What Good Critique Looks Like
  - Specific examples of helpful vs unhelpful feedback
  - Requested format with priorities

  8. Key Terminology
  - HASS, RepliCATS, RDMAP, FAIR, CARE, HARKing, Track A/B, etc.

  What to Provide the External Reviewer

  Minimum (sufficient for good review):
  1. CONTEXT-FOR-EXTERNAL-REVIEW.md (just created)
  2. credibility-implementation-plan-detailed.md (the plan under review)

  Optional (for deeper context):
  3. paper-credibility-analysis-framework.md (design decisions)
  4. research-approach-classification-framework.md (classification spec)

  The context document is designed to:
  - ✅ Give enough background without overwhelming
  - ✅ Highlight HASS-specific considerations (crucial for appropriate
  critique)
  - ✅ Point to specific areas of uncertainty/concern
  - ✅ Request structured, actionable feedback

  Ready to send to Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT-4o? The context + implementation
  plan should give them everything needed for substantive critique.

> ok, I think we got some valuable feedback from ChatGPT5.1 (currently 
rather better than Gemini 2.5). I dropped it into a new folder under 
'planning', as I think we should probably do this more often: 
gpt51-feedback/. Please review it carefully and see what you think. Do not 
simply accept or reject suggestions, be critical but fair: where you see 
genuine weaknesses, carefully formulate an improvement. Where you see good 
advice or opportunities for imnprovement, integrate them. Where you see 
areas that are underdeveloped and that need more research or further 
guidance from me, ask (if more than 1-2 questions, place in document - we 
could create a new planning forlder for interactive documents if you think 
it would improve organisation). This was quite valuable, we should seek 
these second opinions more often.

      .md)

● Excellent external review! This is genuinely valuable feedback. Let me
  analyse it critically and fairly, distinguishing between:
  1. Strong critiques requiring action (legitimate weaknesses)
  2. Good opportunities to adopt (improvements we should take)
  3. Valid concerns needing your input (design decisions requiring
  discussion)
  4. Critiques we should respectfully challenge (where our design is
  actually sound)

  Let me work through this systematically:

     # Synthesis: External Feedback Analysis
     ## Critical Response to GPT-5.1 Review
     **Document Purpose:** Analyse GPT-5.1 feedback, identify genuine
     improvements vs areas where our design is sound

     … +779 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive critical analysis of the GPT-5.1
  feedback. Here's what I found:

  Summary of My Analysis

  GPT-5.1's review quality: A- (Genuinely valuable, domain-aware, identifies
   real weaknesses)

  Key Takeaways

  Strong critiques I fully accept (10 items):
  1. Track A is operationally toothless ← Best critique, completely right
  2. Approach-specific assessment needs concrete anchors ← Valid, needs
  operationalization
  3. Validation under-powered ← Right, need test-retest reliability
  4. Canonical assessment.json ← Excellent idea for corpus analysis
  5. Plus 6 more specific improvements

  Critiques I challenge or defer (4 items):
  1. 7 prompts → fragmentation risk - Valid concern, but defer to empirical
  test (Phase 1)
  2. Reduce to 1-2 pages - Reject; our use case needs detail for refinement
  3. Hard metric-signal rules - Reject; too rigid, defeats LLM flexibility
  4. Cross-model ensembles - Interesting but premature; defer to later

  Three questions I need your input on:

  Q1: Skill Architecture (High Priority)

  Should we:
  - A) Extend research-assessor skill (original plan - single skill,
  integrated)
  - B) Create separate credibility-assessor skill (GPT-5.1 - separation of
  concerns)
  - C) Hybrid approach?

  Q2: RepliCATS Access (Medium Priority)

  Do we have access to repliCATS corpus papers + expert scores for early
  validation pilot?

  Q3: Gold Standard Micro-Corpus (Lower Priority)

  Would you manually assess 3-5 papers (~6-15 hours) to create human
  baseline for Phase 4?

  What I Created

  planning/synthesis-external-feedback.md - Detailed analysis including:
  - Critique-by-critique evaluation
  - Concrete improvements for each accepted recommendation
  - Arguments for challenges/rejections
  - Categorized action items (Adopt/Conditional/Defer/Decline)

  Highlights of improvements to integrate:
  - Track A quality gating with explicit state machine: {High → Full report}
   {Moderate → Caveated} {Low → Abort}
  - Approach-specific scoring anchors (concrete 0-100 scales per approach)
  - Test-retest reliability checks (run 3x, measure SD)
  - Canonical assessment.json for corpus analysis
  - Metric-signal divergence monitoring in Track A

  Your Thoughts?

  What do you think of:
  1. My critical analysis - did I fairly evaluate the feedback?
  2. The three questions - ready to answer or need more context?
  3. GPT-5.1's review overall - worth doing more of these external reviews?

  Once you answer the 3 questions, I'll revise the implementation plan
  (v2.0) incorporating all accepted improvements.
