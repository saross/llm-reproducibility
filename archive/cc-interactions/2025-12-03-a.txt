● The Pass 8 classification prompt doesn't exist yet. Let me check what
  assessment prompts are available:

● Search(pattern: "assessment-system/prompts/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 7 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/classify-research-approach.md)
  ⎿  Read 1471 lines

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/track-a-quality-gating.md)
  ⎿  Read 506 lines

● Now I have the prompts for Pass 8 and Track A quality gating. Let me
  proceed with the assessment pipeline. First, I'll generate the
  classification.json (Pass 8).

  Based on the extraction.json, this is clearly a methodological paper
  (software tool) - FAIMS Mobile. The example in the classification prompt
  even uses this exact paper as an example. I'll create the classification
  following that pattern:

     design decisions, and deployment experience. Results section describes 
     software features, adoption metrics, and user feedback, not substantive
      research findings about archaeological or other phenomena. Three 
     archaeological case studies included (referenced from Sobotkova et al.,
      2016) serve demonstrative/illustrative function, not as primary 
     contribution. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a 
     paper USING a method to study phenomena.",

● Now I'll generate the Track A quality gating assessment (Pass 8.5):

● Now I need to proceed with Pass 9 (cluster assessments). Let me read the
  cluster prompts:

  ⎿  Read 670 lines

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/cluster-3-reproducibility.md)
  ⎿  Read 556 lines

● Now I have all three cluster prompts. Let me generate the cluster
  assessment files. This is a methodological paper (software tool), so I
  need to apply the methodological paper anchors appropriately.

● Now I need to generate the final credibility report (Pass 10). Let me read
   the credibility report prompt:

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/credibility-report.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Search(pattern: "assessment-system/prompts/*credibility*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(assessment-system/prompts/10-final-report-prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 473 lines

● Now I can generate the final credibility report. Let me calculate the
  aggregate score:
  - Comprehensibility: 85
  - Transparency: 90
  - Plausibility: 80
  - Validity: 75
  - Robustness: 55
  - Generalisability: 70
  - Reproducibility: 85

  Aggregate = (85 + 90 + 80 + 75 + 55 + 70 + 85) / 7 = 540 / 7 = 77.1 → 77
  (Good)
