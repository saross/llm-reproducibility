● Excellent! The extraction workflow for sobotkova-et-al-2021 is now complete. Here's a summary of what was
  accomplished:

  Extraction Complete: Sobotkova et al. 2021

  Final Statistics

  - Total Items: 175
    - Evidence: 66
    - Claims: 73
    - Implicit Arguments: 6
    - Research Designs: 2
    - Methods: 8 (6 explicit, 2 implicit)
    - Protocols: 20 (13 explicit, 7 implicit)

  RDMAP Highlights

  - Total RDMAP: 30 items (2 designs, 8 methods, 20 protocols)
  - Implicit RDMAP: 9 items (30.0%)
  - Consolidations: 2 workflow integrations (6.25% reduction)
  - Hierarchy: 100% linking completeness (all protocols→methods→designs)

  Validation Results

  - Status: PASS ✓
  - Sourcing Completeness: 100% across all item types
  - Critical Issues: 0
  - Schema Compliance: 100%

  Key Extraction Decisions

  1. Conservative consolidation: Accepted 6.25% reduction as appropriate for technical paper with
  well-differentiated procedures
  2. Workflow integration pattern: P011/P012 daily workflows subsumed P001/P002 core methodologies
  3. Implicit extraction: 9 implicit RDMAP items identified via 4-pattern systematic scanning
  4. Design context fix: Added design_context references to all 8 methods during validation

  Files Generated

  - extraction.json - Complete extraction (175 items)
  - validation_report.json - Detailed validation results
  - summary.md - Comprehensive extraction summary
  - 11 Python extraction/validation scripts documenting the complete workflow

  Ready for Assessment

  The extraction passes all structural validation checks and is ready for credibility assessment. The 100%
  sourcing completeness ensures all extracted content can be verified against the source paper.

  All tasks complete!
