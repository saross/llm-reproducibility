  Anticipated Extraction Challenges

  1. Pollen Data Granularity

  Challenge: Paper presents pollen data for 5 phases across multiple taxa - risk of over-extraction if every taxon
  percentage is treated as separate evidence.

  Strategy:
  - Extract phase-level summaries as primary evidence (e.g., "Phase 1 dominated by Artemisia 24-37%, Poaceae 8-25%")
  - Extract specific taxa only when they drive key interpretations
  - Consolidate in Pass 2 where multiple taxa support single vegetation claim

  2. Multi-Site Regional Comparison

  Challenge: Discussion includes comparative analysis of 14 pollen sites across Bulgaria - could generate excessive
  evidence items.

  Strategy:
  - Focus on comparative patterns rather than site-by-site data
  - Extract regional synthesis claims
  - Extract only comparative data directly supporting Straldzha interpretations

  3. Nested Temporal Scales

  Challenge: Paper operates at multiple temporal scales (Lateglacial/Holocene transitions, individual phases, specific
  events like 8200 cal BP).

  Strategy:
  - Clearly tag temporal scope in evidence items
  - Distinguish phase-specific claims from broader temporal patterns
  - Preserve temporal resolution critical for assessment

  4. Interdisciplinary Integration

  Challenge: Paper integrates palynology, archaeology, climate science, geomorphology - evidence and claims span multiple
   domains.

  Strategy:
  - Maintain disciplinary distinctions in item types
  - Extract integrative claims separately from domain-specific evidence
  - Preserve interdisciplinary bridging arguments as implicit arguments

  5. Implicit Standard Procedures

  Challenge: Many palynological procedures are "standard" but not fully documented (e.g., pollen identification keys,
  microscopy settings, preservation criteria).

  Strategy:
  - Systematic whole-paper scan in Pass 4 for mentioned-but-undocumented procedures
  - Identify operationally necessary steps not explicitly described
  - Focus on procedures where choices affect results

  6. Human Impact Interpretation

  Challenge: Section 4.3 makes complex inferences about settlement patterns and subsistence based on limited
  archaeological data integrated with pollen evidence.

  Strategy:
  - Distinguish direct palaeoecological evidence from archaeological evidence
  - Extract integrative claims separately
  - Identify implicit assumptions linking ecological signals to human activities

  ---
  Quality Control Targets

  Sourcing Compliance

  - Target: 100% sourcing completeness
  - Explicit items: verbatim_quote with page number
  - Implicit items: trigger_text with inference_reasoning

  Cross-Reference Integrity

  - Evidence → Claims: All evidence must support at least one claim
  - Claims → Evidence: All claims must cite supporting evidence
  - Methods → Designs: All methods must implement at least one design
  - Protocols → Methods: All protocols must implement at least one method
  - Bidirectional validation: Pass 6 verification with systematic repair

  Implicit RDMAP Targets

  - Percentage: 15-25% of total RDMAP
  - Focus areas:
    - Pollen identification and classification decisions
    - Data quality and filtering criteria
    - Statistical parameter selection
    - Model comparison and selection
    - Temporal and spatial binning rules

  Consolidation Discipline

  - Pass 2: Conservative consolidation of claims/evidence (target 15-20% reduction)
  - Pass 5: Conservative consolidation of RDMAP (target 10-15% reduction)
  - Rationale: Palaeoecological paper with genuinely distinct proxies, phases, and analytical methods - preserve
  technical distinctions
  - Complete traceability: Document all consolidations with consolidated_from metadata

  ---
  Anticipated Implicit Arguments

  Based on paper structure, expect implicit arguments in:

  1. Proxy-environment relationships:
    - IA: Pollen percentages reflect regional vegetation composition
    - IA: Charcoal abundance indicates fire frequency/intensity
    - IA: Magnetic susceptibility reflects sediment source and processes
  2. Temporal interpretation:
    - IA: Simultaneous changes across proxies require common cause
    - IA: Age-depth model adequately represents temporal uncertainty
    - IA: Phase boundaries represent real environmental transitions
  3. Human impact inference:
    - IA: Cereal pollen indicates agriculture (vs wild grasses)
    - IA: Deforestation signal reflects human activity (vs climate)
    - IA: Settlement density correlates with landscape impact
  4. Regional extrapolation:
    - IA: Straldzha record represents broader Thracian Plain
    - IA: Large site (14,000 ha) provides regional-scale signal
    - IA: Comparisons to other sites are temporally valid
  5. Climate-vegetation linkages:
    - IA: Vegetation changes reflect climate (vs other drivers)
    - IA: Black Sea moisture balance affects inland vegetation
    - IA: Solar forcing drives seasonal precipitation patterns

  Special Considerations

  1. Comparison to Penske et al. 2013

  - Penske: Archaeogenetics (248 items, high RDMAP density, 20.9% implicit)
  - Connor: Palaeoecology (estimated 185-210 items, moderate RDMAP, target 15-25% implicit)
  - Key difference: Connor has detailed methods but likely more implicit standard procedures in palynology

  2. Domain-Specific Vocabulary

  - Palynological terms (e.g., "acetolysis", "Lycopodium spike", "density separation")
  - Geochronological terms (e.g., "cal. BP", "Marine Isotope Stages", "Bayesian age modelling")
  - Vegetation terms (e.g., "cold steppe", "forest-steppe", "Euxinian longoz forests")
  - Ensure precise terminology in extractions

  3. Methodological Complexity

  - Multiple proxies require separate method/protocol chains
  - Statistical analyses have hierarchical structure (data → transformation → analysis → interpretation)
  - Age-depth modelling requires careful extraction of assumptions and parameters
