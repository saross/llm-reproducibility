Three archaeological projects (Boncuklu, MEMSAP, PAZC) provide empirical evidence for claims about co-development benefits, but the paper's primary contribution is the generalised software model and deployment methodology rather than archaeological findings per se. Mixed methods approach combines qualitative deployment experiences with quantitative time/cost savings data.",
