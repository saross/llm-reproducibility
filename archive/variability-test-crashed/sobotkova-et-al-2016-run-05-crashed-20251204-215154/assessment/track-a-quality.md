## Quality State Determination

### Extraction Quality Assessment

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Evidence completeness | High | 35 evidence items covering all case studies and quantitative data |
| Claims coverage | High | 50 claims capturing methodological arguments and empirical observations |
| RDMAP extraction | High | 5 research designs, 7 methods, 10 protocols identified |
| Cross-references | High | Evidence-claim and RDMAP linkages established |
| Verbatim quotes | High | Present for all explicit items |
| Implicit items | Moderate | 8 implicit arguments with trigger text and reasoning |

**Extraction Quality Score:** HIGH

### Metric-Signal Alignment

| Signal | Relevant Metrics Available | Alignment Rating |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Comprehensibility | Claims clarity, method descriptions | High |
| Transparency | Data availability, code availability | Moderate |
| Plausibility | Domain-appropriate methods | High |
| Validity | Cross-case comparison | Moderate |
| Robustness | Multiple case studies | Moderate |
| Generalisability | Explicit scope discussion | High |
| Reproducibility | Software availability, protocol description | Moderate |

**Metric-Signal Alignment Score:** MODERATE-HIGH

### Classification Confidence

| Aspect | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Paper type | High | Clearly methodological with case study components |
| Research approach | High | Inductive approach evident throughout |
| HARKing risk | Low | No indicators detected |

**Classification Confidence Score:** HIGH

## Quality State Determination

**Overall Quality State: HIGH**

Rationale:
- Extraction completeness exceeds thresholds for all item types
- Strong evidence-claim linkages enable signal assessment
- Classification is unambiguous (methodological paper, inductive approach)
- No assessment blockers identified
- Mixed methods design with both qualitative and quantitative evidence

## Assessment Pathway

**Recommended Pathway:** Full Track A Assessment

The extraction quality supports precise scoring (not banded) for all seven signals. Assessment can proceed without caveats.

## Potential Assessment Challenges

1. **Conflict of Interest:** Three of six authors are FAIMS team members evaluating their own platform. This should be noted in Transparency assessment.

2. **Case Study Generalisability:** Three case studies with self-selected participants (project directors who chose to use FAIMS). External validity considerations for Generalisability signal.

3. **Missing Comparison:** No comparison with alternative digital recording platforms. Relevant to Validity and Robustness assessment.

4. **Data Availability:** Interview/correspondence data not deposited. Affects Reproducibility signal scoring.

## Proceed to Cluster Assessment

Quality state HIGH confirmed. Proceed to:
- Cluster 1: Foundational Clarity (Comprehensibility + Transparency)
- Cluster 2: Evidential Strength (Plausibility + Validity + Robustness + Generalisability)
- Cluster 3: Reproducibility
