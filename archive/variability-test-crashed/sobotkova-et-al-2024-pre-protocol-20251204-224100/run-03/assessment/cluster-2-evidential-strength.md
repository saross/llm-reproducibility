## Signal 3: Plausibility (76/100 - Good)

Well-grounded in transfer learning literature. Counterintuitive findings explained through mechanism. Implicit hypothesis limits score.

## Signal 4: Validity (81/100 - Excellent)

773 independent field-verified mounds. Two-run comparison. Appropriate methods. Excellent limitation disclosure.

## Signal 5: Robustness (69/100 - Good)

Meaningful two-run comparison. Consistent failure strengthens conclusions. Limited parameter sensitivity exploration.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (77/100 - Good)

Claims bounded to Kazanlak Valley. Landscape heterogeneity identified. Transfer conditions specified. Single site limits scope.
