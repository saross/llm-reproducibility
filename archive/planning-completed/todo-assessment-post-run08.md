# ARCHIVED: To-Do Assessment Post-RUN-08

**Archive Date:** 2025-10-31
**Original Location:** planning/todo-assessment-post-run08.md
**Superseded By:** planning/active-todo-list.md
**Archival Reason:** Assessment completed, led to creation of active-todo-list.md

---

**Date:** 2025-10-28

**Context:** RUN-08 successfully achieved all extraction goals (balanced coverage, implicit arguments, implicit RDMAP). Now evaluating whether remaining to-do items are still worth pursuing.

---

## Executive Summary

**RUN-08 Results:**
- ✅ 159 items extracted (ranked #3 of 7 runs)
- ✅ 29 RDMAP items (ranked #2 of 7 runs)
- ✅ 5 implicit RDMAP items extracted (Phase 2 goal achieved)
- ✅ 16 implicit arguments extracted
- ✅ 81% evidence mapping, 57% claims with evidence
- ✅ 100% RDMAP hierarchy mapping
- ✅ Complete bidirectional relationships

**Conclusion:** The workflow is production-ready. Most remaining to-do items are **optional enhancements** rather than **blocking issues**.

## Assessment by Document

### 1. remaining-tasks-summary.md

**Status:** Mostly COMPLETE or SUPERSEDED by RUN-08 success

#### Phase 1: Split Architecture (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] Split architecture implemented
- [x] Tested on Sobotkova paper (RUN-08)
- [x] Validated implicit RDMAP extraction works (5 items)

**Assessment:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Phase 1 goals achieved

#### Phase 2: Medium-Term Improvements (OPTIONAL)

**Fix 3: Replace Checkbox with Quality Gate**
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - RUN-08 found 5 implicit items without this
- **Rationale:** Current prompts worked. Enhancement might help consistency across papers.
- **Recommendation:** Test on 2-3 more papers first. If implicit RDMAP extraction is inconsistent, implement. Otherwise defer.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW

**Fix 4: Reframe from Transparency to Content**
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Philosophical improvement
- **Rationale:** RUN-08 succeeded with current framing. May help with executor mindset on future runs.
- **Recommendation:** Low-cost improvement. Consider implementing if updating prompts for other reasons.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW

**Fix 6: Move Recognition Patterns to Main Prompt**
- **Worth it?** ✗ **NO** - RUN-08 succeeded without inline patterns
- **Rationale:** Current reference structure worked fine. Adding inline patterns increases prompt length without proven benefit.
- **Recommendation:** **DEFER INDEFINITELY** - Not needed given current success.
- **Effort:** 45 minutes (saved)
- **Priority:** VERY LOW / SKIP

#### Phase 3: Long-Term Enhancements (DEFERRED)

**Fix 7: Add Mid-Section Checkpoints**
- **Worth it?** ✗ **NO** - Split architecture obviates need
- **Rationale:** Document correctly notes this may not be needed with split architecture. RUN-08 confirms.
- **Recommendation:** **ARCHIVE** - Not needed.
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours (saved)
- **Priority:** VERY LOW / SKIP

---

### 2. future-workflow-improvements.md

**Status:** All marked DEFERRED, remain DEFERRED

**Overall Assessment:** These are "chatbot best practices" identified during successful extraction. RUN-08 achieved good results without them, suggesting they're **nice-to-have** rather than **essential**.

#### Improvement 1: Make Fundamentals Reading Mandatory
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Depends on CC autonomy goals
- **Rationale:** Might help consistency across different executors/papers. RUN-08 succeeded without strict enforcement.
- **Recommendation:** **Test on next 2-3 papers without this change.** If sourcing failures occur, reconsider. Otherwise defer.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW (monitor)

#### Improvement 2: Strengthen Liberal Extraction Mental Model
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Framing improvement
- **Rationale:** RUN-08 achieved good liberal extraction (62→53 items after rationalization). May help consistency.
- **Recommendation:** **Low-cost framing improvement.** Consider if updating Pass 1 prompt for other reasons.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW

#### Improvement 3: Emphasize Relationship Mapping During Extraction
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - RUN-08 achieved 81% evidence mapping
- **Rationale:** Already working well. Enhancement might push to 90%+.
- **Recommendation:** **Optional enhancement.** Good current results suggest not urgent.
- **Effort:** 45 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW

#### Improvement 4: Add Verbatim Quote Quality Standards
- **Worth it?** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Sourcing quality already good
- **Rationale:** RUN-08 passed all validation checks. Standards might prevent edge cases.
- **Recommendation:** **Monitor validation pass rates.** If failures occur, implement. Otherwise defer.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW (monitor)

#### Improvement 5: Add Scope Management Guidance
- **Worth it?** ✗ **NO** - Not a current problem
- **Rationale:** RUN-08 handled full paper extraction well. No evidence of scope overload.
- **Recommendation:** **DEFER INDEFINITELY** - Address only if long papers show quality degradation.
- **Effort:** 30 minutes (saved)
- **Priority:** VERY LOW / SKIP

### 3. QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md

**Status:** Created 2025-10-22, may be SUPERSEDED

**Assessment:** Need to verify which tasks already completed during recent workflow development.

#### Phase 1: Blocking Issues

**Task 1.1: Fix extraction_schema.json**
- **Status:** NEED TO VERIFY
- **Check:** Does current schema have RDMAP status fields, implicit fields?
- **Worth it if incomplete:** ✅ **YES** - Schema completeness is important
- **Priority:** HIGH (if not done) / SKIP (if done)

**Task 1.2: Add RDMAP Section to verification-procedures.md**
- **Status:** NEED TO VERIFY
- **Check:** Does verification-procedures.md have RDMAP section?
- **Worth it if incomplete:** ✅ **YES** - Validation documentation important
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (if not done) / SKIP (if done)

**Task 1.3: Update schema-guide.md to v2.5**
- **Status:** NEED TO VERIFY
- **Check:** Is schema-guide.md at v2.5 with sourcing requirements?
- **Worth it if incomplete:** ✅ **YES** - Documentation consistency important
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (if not done) / SKIP (if done)

#### Phase 2: High-Priority Fixes

**Tasks 2.1-2.6:** Standardization and documentation improvements
- **Status:** NEED TO VERIFY
- **Worth it:** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Documentation polish, not blocking
- **Priority:** LOW (nice-to-have)

#### Phase 3: Nice to Have

**Tasks 3.1-3.3:** Examples and formatting
- **Status:** Deferred
- **Worth it:** ✗ **NO** - Polish items, very low priority
- **Priority:** VERY LOW / SKIP

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Verify QA Remediation Plan completion status:**
   - Check if schema v2.5 updates are complete
   - Check if verification-procedures.md has RDMAP section
   - Check if schema-guide.md is at v2.5

2. **Based on verification:**
   - If complete: **Archive QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md** as completed
   - If incomplete: Decide whether to complete blocking items

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Papers)

3. **Monitor extraction quality without enhancements:**
   - Track implicit RDMAP extraction consistency
   - Track sourcing validation pass rates
   - Track relationship mapping completeness

4. **Decide on enhancements based on monitoring:**
   - If issues arise: Implement relevant improvements
   - If quality remains high: Defer enhancements indefinitely

### Archive Now

5. **Move to archive/planning-completed/ (create if needed):**
   - remaining-tasks-summary.md (Phase 1 complete)
   - Any other obsolete planning documents

---

## Recommended Repository Cleanup

### Archive Completed Work
Create: `archive/planning-completed/`

Move to archive:
- `remaining-tasks-summary.md` → Note Phase 1 complete
- Any other obsolete plans

### Keep Active
- `future-workflow-improvements.md` → Monitoring checklist
- `QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` → Pending verification

### Future Planning
- Create `planning/monitoring-checklist.md` with quality metrics to track
- Create `planning/next-papers-queue.md` for testing diverse papers

## Success Criteria for Production Readiness

**RUN-08 demonstrates:**
✅ Balanced extraction across all categories
✅ Implicit RDMAP extraction working
✅ Implicit arguments extraction working
✅ High relationship mapping completeness
✅ Complete RDMAP hierarchy
✅ Validation passing

**Therefore:**
**System is PRODUCTION-READY for expanding to additional papers.**

**Recommendation:** Test on 2-3 diverse papers (different fields, transparency levels) to validate generalizability. Monitor quality metrics. Implement enhancements only if issues arise.

---

## Final Recommendation

**START TESTING ON NEW PAPERS** rather than continuing refinement of current prompts.

**Rationale:**
- RUN-08 achieved all extraction goals
- Current workflow is balanced and comprehensive
- Remaining to-do items are optional enhancements
- Real-world testing will reveal actual needs better than theoretical improvements
- Diverse papers will stress-test the workflow

**Next steps:**
1. Archive completed planning documents
2. Verify QA remediation status
3. Create queue of diverse test papers
4. Run 2-3 extractions monitoring quality
5. Reassess enhancements based on real issues (not theoretical)
