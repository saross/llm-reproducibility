# Validation Report - Pass 5

**Paper:** Creating large, high-quality geospatial datasets from historical maps using novice volunteers
**Authors:** Sobotkova et al. (2023)
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Extractor:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** ✅ PASS

Extraction completed successfully across all 5 passes with strong structural integrity and sourcing discipline.

**Extraction Counts:**
- Evidence: 10 items
- Claims: 19 items
- Implicit Arguments: 7 items
- Research Designs: 2 items
- Methods: 4 items
- Protocols: 6 items
- **Total:** 48 items extracted

## Structural Integrity Checks

### Schema Compliance
✅ All items conform to schema v2.5 requirements
✅ Required fields populated across all object types
✅ ID sequences valid and unique
✅ Cross-reference IDs resolve correctly

### Sourcing Verification
✅ All evidence items have verbatim_quote fields
✅ All claims have verbatim_quote fields
✅ All implicit arguments have trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning
✅ All explicit RDMAP items have verbatim_quote fields
✅ No implicit RDMAP items (all documented in Methods/Approach sections)

### Cross-Reference Integrity
✅ Evidence→Claims references valid (10 evidence items support 19 claims)
✅ Claims→Evidence references valid (bidirectional consistency)
✅ Implicit arguments→Claims references valid (7 implicit arguments enable 8 core claims)
✅ Research Designs→Methods→Protocols hierarchy intact
✅ RDMAP→Claims validation references appropriate

## Content Quality Assessment

### Claims & Evidence (Passes 1-2)
- **Comprehensiveness:** Good coverage of key empirical findings and interpretations
- **Balance:** Appropriate mix of core (8), intermediate (7), and supporting (4) claims
- **Evidence Quality:** Quantitative outcomes well-documented with verbatim quotes
- **Implicit Arguments:** Systematic scans completed for core claims, revealing key unstated assumptions about efficiency metrics, generalisability, and methodological adequacy

### RDMAP (Passes 3-4)
- **Research Designs:** 2 designs capture strategic framing (comparative design, usability framework)
- **Methods:** 4 methods cover data collection, sampling, and evaluation approaches
- **Protocols:** 6 protocols document operational procedures from map prep to QA
- **Three-Tier Hierarchy:** Clear WHY→WHAT→HOW relationships maintained
- **Explicit/Implicit:** All items explicit (well-documented in Approach section) - indicates good methodological transparency in original paper

## Completeness Assessment

### Expected Information Present
✅ Core research question/hypotheses captured (comparative evaluation)
✅ Sample characteristics documented (novice undergraduate volunteers)
✅ Data collection methods specified (FAIMS Mobile customisation)
✅ Analysis approach described (time-on-task measurement, error rate calculation)
✅ Validation procedures documented (random sampling QA)

### Known Gaps
- Some Introduction literature review content not extracted as separate claims (appropriately treated as supporting context)
- Detailed technical specifications of FAIMS Mobile could be extracted as additional protocols if needed for full replication
- Comparison calculations in Discussion could be extracted as additional evidence if granular cost-benefit analysis needed

## Assessment Blockers

**None identified.**

The extraction provides sufficient detail for:
- Transparency assessment (methods well-documented)
- Replicability assessment (key procedures specified)
- Credibility assessment (systematic evaluation with error rates)

## Recommendations

1. **For Future Extractions:** Consider extracting more granular protocols for full technical replication (e.g., specific FAIMS Mobile configuration details, map tile specifications)

2. **For Pass 6 (if implemented):** Could benefit from extracting quantitative thresholds as separate evidence items (e.g., specific payoff thresholds for different approaches)

3. **For Assessment Use:** Current extraction provides strong foundation for evaluating:
   - Methodological transparency (explicit documentation)
   - Comparative validity (multiple baselines)
   - Reproducibility (procedures specified)

## Validation Outcome

**Status:** ✅ EXTRACTION COMPLETE AND VALIDATED

**Ready for:**
- Transparency analysis
- Reproducibility assessment
- Comparative evaluation
- Integration with other extractions

**Quality Rating:** High confidence - systematic extraction with proper sourcing discipline throughout all passes.
