## Core Findings

### Key Claims (Core Level)

**C001**: Historical map data extraction is costly
**C009**: Crowdsourcing most efficient for 10,000–60,000 features
**C010**: Field data systems can be customised as participatory GIS for novices
**C029**: Optimal dataset size range based on payoff threshold analysis
**C032**: Small archaeology projects can deploy collaborative systems despite lacking ML resources

### Key Evidence

**E001**: 10,827 features digitised from Soviet topographic maps
**E002**: 241 person-hours (57 staff, 184 volunteers)
**E003**: Error rate under 6%
**E014**: Setup/customisation: 51 hours total
**E018**: Payoff threshold: 3,400-4,300 features vs staff digitisation

### Implicit Assumptions

**IA001**: Cost barriers justify seeking alternatives
**IA002**: ML expertise barriers for typical archaeology projects
**IA003**: Platform adaptation more accessible than ML expertise

## Research Methodology Summary

### Research Design (Representative)
- Case study methodology for theory building
- Comparative evaluation against alternatives (desktop GIS, ML)
- Abductive reasoning approach (iterative observation-theory development)

### Methods (Representative)
- Crowdsourced map digitisation using mobile devices
- FAIMS Mobile platform customisation
- Performance measurement through time-on-task tracking
- Quality assurance through statistical sampling
- Cost-benefit analysis for efficiency assessment

### Context
- Fieldwork setting: Bulgaria, 2017-2018
- Opportunistic digitisation during weather delays
- Secondary activity alongside primary survey work
- Novice volunteers (undergraduate field school students)

## Phase A + B-1 Test Results

### Frameworks Tested
✅ evidence-vs-claims-guide.md - Boundary maintained
✅ tier-assignment-guide.md - WHY/WHAT/HOW correctly applied
✅ research-design-operational-guide.md Section 9 - Reasoning classified
✅ research-design-operational-guide.md Section 11 - Fieldwork context noted

### Test Verdict
**PASS** - All skill file references work correctly. Phase A + B-1 validated.

## Paper Contribution

**Problem**: Historical map digitisation costly; ML requires expertise; desktop GIS scales poorly
**Solution**: Customised mobile GIS for crowdsourced digitisation by novices
**Finding**: Efficient for 10K-60K feature datasets; complementary to ML

**Significance**: Demonstrates field data collection systems can serve participatory geospatial roles
