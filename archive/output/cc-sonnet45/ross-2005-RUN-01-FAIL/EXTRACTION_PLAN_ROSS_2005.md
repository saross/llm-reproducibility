**Purpose:** First literary/philological analysis paper in corpus - model for interpretive textual analysis without formal empirical methods

---

## Paper Overview

**Full Citation**: Ross, S.A. (2005). Barbarophonos: Language and Panhellenism in the Iliad. Classical Philology, 100(4), 299-316.

**Paper Type**: Literary/philological analysis combining close reading of Homeric texts with historical-linguistic interpretation and scholarly debate engagement

**Total Length**: 18 pages (including bibliography)

**Main Text**: Approximately 16 pages (excluding bibliography)

**Slug**: ross-2005

**Discipline**: Classical Philology / Ancient History

**Key Characteristics**:

- Literary/philological textual analysis (NOT empirical research)
- Close reading of ancient Greek epic poetry (Iliad, Odyssey, Hesiod, Homeric Hymns)
- Interpretive argumentation building through cumulative textual evidence
- Engagement with scholarly debates about Panhellenism and Greek identity formation
- Historical-linguistic contextualization (8th century BCE Greek identity)
- Thesis-driven structure (proto-Panhellenism evident in linguistic patterns)

---

## Research Design

**Primary Research Question**: To what extent was Panhellenism present in early Archaic Greece as reflected in Homeric epic?

**Specific Questions Addressed**:

1. How does the Iliad represent linguistic diversity among Trojans vs linguistic unity among Akhaians?
2. What role does language play as an identity marker in early Greek epic poetry?
3. Does the Iliad reflect proto-Panhellenic consciousness or later classical Greek/barbarian dichotomy?
4. What is the relationship between linguistic patterns in the Iliad and broader early Greek identity formation?

**Key Analytical Approaches** (literary analysis lacks formal "methods"):

- Close reading and textual interpretation of Greek epic passages
- Comparative analysis across multiple early Greek epic texts
- Philological analysis of specific Greek terms (barbarophonos, glōssa)
- Historical-linguistic contextualisation (8th century stabilisation of oral tradition)
- Scholarly debate engagement and positioning
- Pattern identification across epic corpus (Iliad, Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony, Homeric Hymns)

**Study Focus**: Passages in early Greek epic poetry that explicitly mention language, speech, or linguistic diversity - particularly barbarophonos and related terms

**Dating Context**: 8th century BCE as period of Homeric text stabilisation and proto-Panhellenic identity emergence

---

## Section Structure for Pass 1 & Pass 3

### Target Parameters

- **Ideal section length**: 1000 ±250 words (750-1250 words)
- **Absolute maximum**: 1500 words
- **Rationale**: Sections >1500 words systematically underextract
- **CRITICAL**: Same 10 sections used for Pass 1 (claims/evidence) AND Pass 3 (RDMAP)

### Greek Text Handling Strategy

**Block Quotes in Greek**: Ignore - always fully translated in adjacent English block quotes. Extract from English translation only.

**Single Greek Words**: Handle case-by-case as they arise. Translations may be provided on first use but not guaranteed. Improvise using context and scholarly conventions:

- barbarophonos = "barbarian-tongued" / "foreign-speaking"
- glōssa = "language" / "tongue"
- epikouroi = "allies" / "auxiliary forces"
- polis = "city-state"
- aristeia = "prowess scene"

**Technical Conventions**: Preserve standard scholarly citation format (e.g., "Il. 2.802-6" = Iliad Book 2, lines 802-806; "Od. 19.172-77" = Odyssey Book 19, lines 172-177).

## Estimated Item Counts

### Pass 1 (Liberal Extraction)

**Claims**: 100-125 items

- Explicit interpretive claims: ~70-85
- Implicit interpretive claims: ~30-40 (HIGH for literary analysis)
- Focus: Interpretations of linguistic patterns, scholarly positions, historical implications, textual meanings, proto-Panhellenic identity arguments

**Evidence**: 20-30 items

- Textual quotations from ancient sources: ~15-22
  - Iliad passages: ~6-8
  - Odyssey passages: ~2-3
  - Hesiod Theogony passages: ~1-2
  - Homeric Hymns passages: ~3-5
  - Greek terms with scholarly interpretation: ~3-4
- Scholarly citations supporting positions: ~5-8
- Note: Much lower evidence count than empirical papers - evidence is textual passages, not data

**Implicit Arguments**: 20-30 items (HIGH for interpretive paper)

- Unstated theoretical frameworks (oral tradition theory, identity formation models)
- Interpretive assumptions (linguistic patterns → identity markers)
- Bridging arguments between textual evidence and historical conclusions
- Assumptions about 8th century context

### Pass 2 (Rationalisation)

Expected reduction: 10-15%

- Claims: 85-110 items (remove ~15-20 redundant interpretations or weakly-supported inferences)
- Evidence: 18-26 items (remove ~2-4 marginal citations or overlapping quotations)
- Implicit Arguments: 18-26 items (remove ~2-4 weak inferences)

### Pass 3 (Liberal RDMAP)

**IMPORTANT**: Literary analysis has fundamentally different RDMAP structure than empirical papers. Expect MUCH LOWER counts.

**Research Designs**: 2-4 items (very limited - this is not hypothesis-driven research)

- Overarching interpretive framework: language as identity marker in Homer
- Proto-Panhellenism investigation design
- Comparative textual analysis approach across epic corpus
- Historical-linguistic contextualisation design (8th century)

**Methods**: 6-10 items (interpreting "methods" broadly as analytical approaches)

- Close reading / textual interpretation
- Comparative analysis across epic texts
- Philological analysis of Greek terms
- Historical-linguistic contextualisation
- Scholarly debate engagement methodology
- Pattern identification across corpus
- Genre comparison (epic vs hymnic traditions)
- Divine-human dichotomy analysis

**Protocols**: 8-15 items (very thin - no formal protocols in literary analysis)

- Text selection criteria (passages mentioning language/speech)
- Dating framework rationale (8th century stabilisation)
- Translation approach to Greek terms
- Citation conventions (scholarly format for ancient texts)
- Comparative framework justification (why compare Iliad, Odyssey, Hesiod, Hymns?)
- Scholarly positioning strategy
- Passage boundary determination
- Greek term transliteration conventions

### Pass 4 (Implicit RDMAP)

Expected additions: 3-6 items

- Implicit interpretive framework choices
- Unstated assumptions about oral tradition stability
- Background theoretical framework (identity formation theory)
- Implicit text selection criteria beyond explicit statement
- Unstated comparison methodology choices
- Implicit assumptions about 8th century context

### Pass 5 (RDMAP Rationalisation)

Expected reduction: 15-20%

- Research Designs: 2-3 items (minimal consolidation)
- Methods: 5-8 items (consolidate overlapping analytical approaches)
- Protocols: 6-12 items (consolidate related conventions)

### Final Expected Totals

**Claims + Evidence + Implicit Arguments**: 121-162 items

- Claims: 85-110
- Evidence: 18-26
- Implicit Arguments: 18-26

**RDMAP**: 13-23 items

- Research Designs: 2-3
- Methods: 5-8
- Protocols: 6-12

**Grand Total**: 134-185 items

**Note**: These totals are substantially lower than empirical papers (Connor 2013: 247 items; Penske et al. 2023: 248 items) because:

1. Shorter paper (18 vs 44-53 pages)
2. Interpretive methodology lacks formal RDMAP structure
3. Evidence is textual quotations rather than data
4. More implicit argumentation typical of literary analysis
5. No complex analytical workflows or laboratory protocols

---

## Quality Control Targets

### Sourcing Discipline

- **100% sourcing requirement**: Every item must have page number
- **Verbatim quotes**: Required for all explicit claims/evidence with direct quotations from paper
- **Trigger text**: Required for all implicit items to document inference basis
- **Ancient text citations**: Use standard scholarly format (e.g., "Il. 2.802-6") in evidence items

### Cross-Reference Integrity

- Evidence items must reference related claims (bidirectional)
- Claims should reference supporting textual evidence where applicable
- Implicit arguments should reference related claims they support
- Minimum 80% cross-reference completeness (lower than empirical due to interpretive nature)

### RDMAP Simplified Structure

**IMPORTANT**: Literary analysis does NOT have the same hierarchical RDMAP structure as empirical papers.

- Methods should link to research designs where applicable (but many may not)
- Protocols should link to methods where applicable (but many are standalone conventions)
- Expect more orphaned items than empirical papers - this is acceptable
- RDMAP is capturing interpretive approach, not procedural workflow

### Implicit Item Threshold

- Target: **30-40% of claims should be implicit** (HIGH for interpretive paper)
- Target: **20-30% of RDMAP items should be implicit**
- Evidence: primarily explicit (should be <15% implicit)
- Implicit Arguments: Expect 18-26 items (bridging unstated assumptions)

---

## Anticipated Challenges

### 1. Absence of Traditional RDMAP Structure

- **Problem**: Literary analysis lacks formal research designs, methods, and protocols as understood in empirical science
- **Strategy**:
  - Interpret "research design" as overarching interpretive framework
  - Treat "methods" as analytical approaches (close reading, comparison, philology)
  - Consider "protocols" as conventions and selection criteria
  - Accept much lower RDMAP counts (13-23 vs 60-80 typical)
  - Focus Pass 3 on identifying implicit methodological choices
  - Don't force artificial empirical structure

### 2. High Proportion of Implicit Claims

- **Problem**: Interpretive arguments often built through suggestion, implication, and cumulative evidence rather than explicit statement
- **Strategy**:
  - Expect 30-40% implicit claims (vs 20-25% typical)
  - Use trigger_text extensively to document inferential basis
  - Mark uncertain interpretations during Pass 1 for Pass 2 review
  - Distinguish between: (a) explicitly stated interpretations, (b) strongly implied interpretations, (c) weak reader inferences
  - Be conservative: only extract well-supported implicit claims

### 3. Scholarly Debate Integration

- **Problem**: Paper extensively engages with other scholars' positions (Finley, Mackie, Nagy, Hall, Cartledge, etc.), creating potential confusion between Ross's claims vs others' positions
- **Strategy**:
  - Clearly attribute claims to Ross vs cited scholars in item content
  - Extract Ross's interpretation/response to others' positions as claims
  - Use cross-references to link Ross's claims to summarised scholarly positions
  - Consider adding claim_source metadata (Ross_interpretation vs Ross_summary_of_Finley)
  - In Pass 2, consolidate redundant summaries of same scholarly position

### 4. Evidence is Textual Quotations

- **Problem**: Evidence items are ancient Greek texts (with English translations), not empirical data
- **Strategy**:
  - Treat quoted passages from Iliad/Odyssey/Hesiod/Hymns as evidence items
  - Extract from **English translation only** (ignore Greek block quotes)
  - Include English translation in verbatim_quote from paper
  - Use evidence_source field to identify which ancient work (e.g., "Iliad 2.802-6")
  - Link multiple claims to same textual evidence (one passage supports multiple interpretations)
  - For single Greek words: handle as they arise, use context and scholarly conventions

### 5. Greek Language Content

- **Problem**: Extensive Greek content requires special handling
- **Strategy**:
  - **Block quotes in Greek**: Ignore completely - always extract from adjacent English translation
  - **Single Greek words**: Handle case-by-case; may or may not have translation on first use
  - Improvise using context: barbarophonos ≈ "barbarian-tongued", glōssa ≈ "language"
  - Preserve Greek terms in verbatim_quote when part of quoted passages
  - Use transliteration in item content text for readability
  - Maintain standard scholarly citation format (Il. 2.802-6, Od. 19.172-77, Hes. Theog. 824-35)

### 6. Argumentative vs Descriptive Structure

- **Problem**: Paper builds cumulative argument rather than reporting methods → results → discussion
- **Strategy**:
  - Don't force artificial Methods/Results/Discussion chunking
  - Follow paper's own argumentative structure: introduction → literature review → cumulative evidence → synthesis
  - Section groupings based on thematic units and argument progression
  - Accept that early sections contain primarily claims (scholarly debate), middle sections contain evidence + claims (textual analysis), final section contains synthesis claims
  - This is normal for literary/philological analysis

### 7. Limited Methodological Transparency

- **Problem**: No explicit methods section; interpretive approach largely implicit
- **Strategy**:
  - Pass 4 (Implicit RDMAP) will be especially critical for this paper
  - Look for methodological choices in:
    - Introduction (dating rationale, oral tradition theory, why linguistic approach?)
    - Text selection decisions (why these passages? why these texts?)
    - Translation and interpretation choices
    - Comparative framework justification (why compare epic to hymns?)
    - Theoretical positioning (identity formation models, Panhellenism emergence theories)
  - Extract theoretical frameworks as implicit research designs
  - Accept that many methodological choices are unstated conventions in classical philology

### 8. Interdisciplinary Terminology

- **Problem**: Paper spans classical philology, ancient history, historical linguistics, and literary criticism
- **Strategy**:
  - Create controlled vocabulary for key concepts:
    - Panhellenism, proto-Panhellenism, oppositional identity, aggregative identity
    - barbarophonos, glōssa, polyglossus
    - epikouroi (allies/auxiliary forces)
    - alterity (otherness)
    - oral tradition theory, formulaic composition
  - Maintain consistent terminology across all items
  - Use item metadata to tag disciplinary perspective where relevant (philological, historical, linguistic, literary-critical)
  - Define technical terms in first extraction, then use consistently

---

## Workflow Execution Notes

### Pass 1 Strategy

- Section-by-section extraction following order above (Sections 1-10)
- **Work in English**: Extract from English translations, ignore Greek block quotes
- **Greek terms**: Handle as they arise; improvise translations using context
- Mark uncertain items with [UNCERTAIN] flag for Pass 2 review
- Over-extract boundary cases (liberal approach, 40-50% over)
- **Attribution critical**: Clearly distinguish Ross's claims from cited scholars' positions
- Track key concepts for controlled vocabulary (proto-Panhellenism, barbarophonos, etc.)
- Expect HIGH implicit claim percentage (30-40%) - this is normal for literary analysis

### Pass 1-2 Attribution Check

- After Pass 1, before Pass 2: Review all claims for clear attribution
- Ensure Ross's interpretations distinguished from:
  - Finley's position (Iliad ignores linguistic diversity)
  - Mackie's order/disorder thesis
  - Nagy's oral tradition framework
  - Hall's aggregative identity model
  - Cartledge's oppositional identity model
- Consolidate redundant summaries of same scholarly position in Pass 2

### Pass 2-3 Transition

- After rationalising claims/evidence, begin RDMAP with Introduction re-read
- RDMAP will be thin - don't expect 60-80 items
- Focus on capturing interpretive approach, not procedural workflow
- Look throughout paper (not just in a "methods" section that doesn't exist)

### Pass 3 Adapted Strategy for Literary Analysis

- **CRITICAL**: Literary analysis requires different RDMAP approach
- **Research Designs**: Cast wide net in Introduction + Conclusions
  - Why investigate linguistic patterns?
  - Why focus on 8th century?
  - Why compare epic to hymnic traditions?
  - What overarching interpretive framework?
- **Methods**: Look for analytical approaches throughout paper
  - How does Ross analyse texts?
  - What comparative framework?
  - What philological techniques?
  - How does Ross engage scholarly debates?
- **Protocols**: Look for conventions and selection criteria
  - What texts selected and why?
  - What dating rationale?
  - What citation conventions?
  - What translation approach?
- **Accept LOW counts**: 16-29 items total is expected (not 100+)

### Pass 4 Focus Areas

- Re-read Introduction for implicit theoretical frameworks
- Re-read Conclusions for implicit interpretive choices
- Check for unstated assumptions about:
  - Oral tradition stability in 8th century
  - Relationship between linguistic patterns and identity formation
  - Why certain passages chosen over others
  - Dating assumptions (8th century as stabilisation period)
- Look for "standard" scholarly conventions mentioned without specification
- Identify implicit comparative methodology choices

### Pass 5 Priorities

- Check if "protocols" are too granular or could be consolidated
- Consolidate overlapping analytical approaches in "methods"
- Ensure research designs capture overarching interpretive framework
- Don't over-consolidate - accept 13-23 final items
- Verify that RDMAP items actually capture interpretive approach (not forced empirical structure)

### Validation Checkpoints

- After Pass 2: Verify attribution clarity (Ross vs cited scholars)
- After Pass 2: Check no duplicate claims with identical verbatim_quote
- After Pass 3: Accept orphaned RDMAP items (literary analysis doesn't have strict hierarchy)
- After Pass 4: Verify implicit claims are well-supported by trigger_text
- After Pass 5: Accept lower cross-reference completeness than empirical papers (80% vs 85%+)

## Notes on This Paper's Value as a Model

This paper represents the first literary/philological analysis in the extraction corpus and serves as a model for:

1. **Interpretive vs Empirical Research**: Demonstrates how to extract from papers without formal methods sections or empirical data - focus on interpretive approaches and textual evidence

2. **Argumentative Structure**: Shows how to handle thesis-driven papers that build cumulative arguments (introduction → evidence → synthesis) rather than IMRaD structure

3. **Scholarly Debate Engagement**: Models extraction from papers that extensively engage with other scholars' positions - requires clear attribution between author's claims and summarised positions

4. **Textual Evidence**: Demonstrates handling of ancient text quotations as evidence (not empirical data) with proper source attribution

5. **Implicit Argumentation**: Shows extraction from highly interpretive papers where 30-40% of claims are implicit - typical for literary/philological analysis

6. **Low RDMAP Structure**: Models extraction from papers without formal research designs, methods, and protocols - captures interpretive approach instead

7. **Interdisciplinary Terminology**: Demonstrates handling of papers spanning multiple fields (classical philology, ancient history, historical linguistics, literary criticism)

8. **Greek Language Content**: Shows strategy for handling ancient Greek text (extract from English translations, improvise single term translations)

9. **Historical-Linguistic Contextualisation**: Models extraction from papers making historical arguments based on linguistic patterns in ancient texts

**Recommended for**: Training on literary/philological analysis, textual interpretation papers, ancient history studies, and any research involving close reading of primary sources without formal empirical methods.

**Comparison to Empirical Models**:

- **Connor 2013** (palaeoenvironmental): 247 items, 72 RDMAP, complex multi-proxy workflows → Empirical extreme
- **Ross 2005** (literary/philological): 134-185 items, 13-23 RDMAP, interpretive approaches → Interpretive extreme

These two papers represent opposite ends of the empirical-interpretive spectrum in HASS research.

## Chunking Strategy for Literary Analysis

**Key Differences from Empirical Papers**:

Unlike empirical papers with IMRaD structure (Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion), literary/philological papers follow argumentative structure:

1. **Introduction & Methodological Framework**: Research question, theoretical positioning
2. **Literature Review**: Scholarly debate engagement, positioning within field
3. **Cumulative Evidence Sections**: Sequential textual analysis building argument (Iliad → Odyssey → Hesiod → Hymns)
4. **Synthesis & Conclusions**: Argument culmination, implications

**Chunking follows argumentative logic**, not empirical workflow:

- **Early sections**: Primarily claims (scholarly positions, theoretical frameworks)
- **Middle sections**: Mixed evidence + claims (textual passages + interpretations)
- **Final section**: Synthesis claims (bringing together cumulative evidence)

**Natural boundaries** determined by:

- Topic shifts (Iliad → Odyssey → Hesiod → Hymns)
- Scholarly debate transitions (oppositional → aggregative Panhellenism)
- Argumentative progression (evidence accumulation → synthesis)

**Result**: 10 sections (600-1400 words each) following paper's own argumentative structure, with natural boundaries at topic/theme shifts.
