# Skill Component Files Verification - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Task:** Deep dive verification of all skill component files to reflect 6-pass split architecture
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary of Changes

All skill component files have been systematically updated to reflect the new 6-pass workflow where RDMAP extraction is split into:
- **Pass 3:** RDMAP Explicit Extraction (documented methodology from Methods section)
- **Pass 4:** RDMAP Implicit Extraction (undocumented items from Results/Discussion)
- **Pass 5:** RDMAP Rationalisation (consolidate all RDMAP)
- **Pass 6:** Validation (formerly Pass 5 in old 5-pass system)

---

## Files Updated

### 1. SKILL.md (Main Skill File)

**Changes:**
- Line 3: Description updated: "five-pass" → "six-pass"
- Lines 15-19: Overview expanded to list all 6 passes with explicit/implicit split
- Lines 37-53: Workflow diagram updated with 6-pass sequence
- Lines 76-82: Task identification updated with separate Pass 3/4/5 entries
- Lines 88-98: Prompt descriptions updated for 3-pass RDMAP workflow
- Line 107: "Pass 1 & 2" → "all extraction passes" (more accurate)
- Line 109: "Pass 3 validation" → "Pass 6 validation"
- Line 117: "Pass 2 & Pass 4" → "Pass 2 & Pass 5" (consolidation passes)
- Lines 144-146: Separation of Concerns clarified with explicit pass numbers
- Lines 190-193: Expected outcomes expanded with Pass 4 implicit item expectations
- Line 192: Old "Pass 3: Validation" → "Pass 6: Validation"

**Result:** ✅ Complete - Main skill file accurately reflects 6-pass architecture

---

### 2. extraction-fundamentals.md

**Changes:**
- Line 3: **Last Updated:** 2025-10-21 → 2025-10-28
- Line 5: **Applies to:** "Pass 1, Pass 2" → "Pass 1-5: Claims/Evidence and RDMAP extraction"
- Line 402: Section heading: "Source Verification (Pass 3)" → "Source Verification (Pass 6)"
- Line 404: "Pass 3 using" → "Pass 6 (Validation) using"

**Result:** ✅ Complete - Sourcing fundamentals updated with correct pass references

---

### 3. verbatim-quote-requirements.md

**Changes:**
- Line 268: "Self-Check Before Pass 3 Validation" → "Self-Check Before Pass 6 Validation"
- Line 390: "pass source verification in Pass 3" → "pass source verification in Pass 6"
- Line 432: "prevents hours of rework in Pass 3" → "prevents hours of rework in Pass 6"
- Line 438: "verification-procedures.md for Pass 3 validation" → "for Pass 6 validation"

**Result:** ✅ Complete - All validation references updated to Pass 6

---

### 4. schema-guide.md

**Changes:**
- Line 53: "for Pass 3 validation" → "for Pass 6 validation"
- Line 63: "Pass 3 can validate" → "Pass 6 can validate"
- Line 111: "Populated in Pass 3" → "Populated in Pass 6"
- Line 151: "Populated in Pass 3" → "Populated in Pass 6" (2 instances, replaced both)
- Line 203: "Populated in Pass 3 (trigger verification)" → "Populated in Pass 6 (trigger verification)"
- Line 531: "Pass 3 validation" → "Pass 6 validation"

**Result:** ✅ Complete - All schema validation references updated to Pass 6

---

### 5. verification-procedures.md

**Changes:**
- Line 41: "during Pass 3 validation" → "during Pass 6 validation"
- Line 192: "during Pass 3 validation" → "during Pass 6 validation"
- Line 352: "during Pass 3 validation" → "during Pass 6 validation"
- Line 1374: "Pass 3 Verification Checklist" → "Pass 6 Verification Checklist"
- Line 1519: "Pass 1 and Pass 3 prompts" → "extraction prompts (Pass 1-5) and the Pass 6 validation prompt"

**Result:** ✅ Complete - Comprehensive verification procedures updated

---

### 6. consolidation-patterns.md

**Changes:**
- Line 519: "Pass 4 rationalisation" → "Pass 5 rationalisation"

**Context:** RDMAP rationalisation moved from Pass 4 (old 5-pass system) to Pass 5 (new 6-pass system) due to implicit extraction being inserted as new Pass 4.

**Result:** ✅ Complete - Consolidation timing references updated

---

## Files NOT Requiring Updates

The following skill component files were reviewed and found to contain no pass-specific references requiring updates:

1. **tier-assignment-guide.md** - Generic tier classification guidance (no pass numbers)
2. **expected-information.md** - Domain-specific completeness checklists (no pass numbers)
3. **research-design-operational-guide.md** - Research design patterns (no pass numbers)
4. **sobotkova-example.md** - Contains "Pass 1 vs Pass 2 Changes" but these are generic examples, not absolute pass numbers

---

## Verification Methodology

**Search patterns used:**
```bash
# Primary search
grep -rn "(five.pass|5.pass|Pass [345]|RDMAP Pass|pass 3|pass 4|pass 5)" skill/research-assessor/

# Workflow references
grep -rn "(Pass 1.*Pass 2|Pass 2.*Pass 3|workflow|sequence)" skill/research-assessor/references/

# Specific pass number checks
grep -n "Pass 3" <each-file>
grep -n "Pass 4" <each-file>
grep -n "Pass 5" <each-file>
```

**Update strategy:**
- Old Pass 3 (validation) → New Pass 6
- Old Pass 4 (RDMAP rationalisation) → New Pass 5
- Old Pass 1-2 references → Expanded to "Pass 1-5" where appropriate
- Generic "Pass 1 & 2" → Clarified as "all extraction passes" or "Pass 1-5"

## Key Architecture Points Reflected in Updates

### Pass Number Mapping (Old → New)

| Old System (5 passes) | New System (6 passes) |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Pass 1: Claims/Evidence liberal | Pass 1: Claims/Evidence liberal [unchanged] |
| Pass 2: Claims/Evidence rationalize | Pass 2: Claims/Evidence rationalize [unchanged] |
| Pass 3: RDMAP liberal (combined) | **Pass 3: RDMAP explicit** [split] |
| - | **Pass 4: RDMAP implicit** [new] |
| Pass 4: RDMAP rationalize | Pass 5: RDMAP rationalize [renumbered] |
| Pass 5: Validation | Pass 6: Validation [renumbered] |

### Rationale for Split

**Cognitive model shift:** Explicit extraction (scanning documented Methods) vs implicit extraction (inferring from Results/Discussion) require fundamentally different mental models. Split enables:
- Singular focus per prompt (explicit: 368 lines, implicit: 273 lines vs combined: 840 lines)
- Natural quality gate (validate explicit before scanning for implicit)
- Reduced cognitive load (no model switching mid-prompt)
- Higher reliability (dedicated focus reduces superficial execution risk)
