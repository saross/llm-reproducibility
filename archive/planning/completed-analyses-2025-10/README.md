# Completed Planning & Analysis Documents - October 2025

**Archived:** 2025-10-28
**Reason:** These documents completed their purpose and led to implemented improvements

---

## Context

These documents were created during the diagnostic and implementation phase of fixing implicit RDMAP extraction and improving comprehensive extraction reliability. All analyses have been completed and their recommendations implemented.

## Implicit RDMAP Extraction Fixes (Complete)

### Diagnostic Documents
1. **implicit-extraction-comparison-analysis.md**
   - Comprehensive diagnostic comparing implicit arguments (working) vs implicit RDMAP (failing)
   - Identified root causes: workflow non-integration, priority ambiguity, pattern accessibility
   - Led to: Split architecture decision + Phase 2 improvements

2. **implicit-arguments-rdmap-regression-investigation.md**
   - Investigation into why implicit RDMAP extraction regressed
   - Confirmed systematic failure (0 items across all runs)

3. **implicit-arguments-gap-diagnosis.md**
   - Initial gap diagnosis for implicit arguments
   - Informed extraction pattern development

### Architecture & Implementation
4. **implicit-extraction-architecture-comparison.md**
   - Evaluated split vs unified prompt architecture for RDMAP extraction
   - Decision: Split into dedicated prompts (Pass 3: explicit, Pass 4: implicit)
   - Rationale: Cognitive model separation for reliability

5. **implicit-rdmap-extraction-fixes-implementation.md**
   - Original 3-phase implementation plan
   - Phase 1: Implemented via split architecture (different approach, same goals)
   - Phase 2: Completed with Fixes 3, 4, 6 (2025-10-28)
   - Phase 3: Deferred (may not be needed with split architecture)
   - **Status:** Superseded by planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md

6. **prompt-architecture-assessment.md**
   - Assessed optimal prompt structure for RDMAP extraction
   - Led to split architecture decision

7. **liberal-extraction-execution-guide.md**
   - Analysis of liberal extraction execution patterns
   - Extracted into remaining-tasks-summary.md as Improvements 1-5

### Verification
8. **skill-component-files-verification-complete.md**
   - Systematic verification of all skill component files for 6-pass structure
   - 31 changes across 6 files documented
   - **Status:** Complete, all files updated

9. **split-architecture-skill-verification.md**
   - Verification that split architecture properly references skill
   - **Status:** Complete, verified

## Research Design & Transparency Fixes (Complete)

10. **research-design-extraction-gap-analysis.md**
    - Diagnosed research design extraction gaps
    - Led to improved design recognition patterns in Prompt 03

11. **transparency-metric-documentation-gap.md**
    - Identified transparency metric documentation issues
    - Improvements implemented

---

## Extraction Comparison & Monitoring (Complete)

12. **chatbot-extraction-02-vs-current-comparison.md**
    - Comparison between chatbot and current extraction approach
    - Analysis completed

13. **RUN-01-vs-current-comparison.md**
    - Comparison of RUN-01 vs current extraction quality
    - Analysis completed

14. **workflow-improvements-from-comparison.md**
    - Identified workflow improvements from comparisons
    - Improvements implemented in remaining-tasks-summary.md

15. **extraction-challenges-monitoring.md**
    - Monitoring of extraction challenges across runs
    - Issues addressed in current improvements

---

## Skill Improvement Implementation (Complete)

16. **skill-improvement-implementation-plan.md**
    - Implementation plan for skill improvements
    - **Status:** Implemented via split architecture

17. **skill-improvement-risk-assessment.md**
    - Risk assessment for skill changes
    - **Status:** Complete, changes implemented safely

---

## Current Status

**All improvements implemented:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Split architecture (6-pass workflow)
- ✅ Phase 2: Implicit RDMAP strengthening (Fixes 3, 4, 6)
- ✅ Comprehensive extraction improvements (mandatory fundamentals, liberal mental model)
- ⏭️ Testing: Ready for RUN-08 with all improvements

**Active planning document:**
- `planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md` - Current roadmap and remaining work

**Testing planned:**
- Full extraction test on Sobotkova et al. 2023
- Validation: implicit RDMAP items > 0, comprehensive extraction working
