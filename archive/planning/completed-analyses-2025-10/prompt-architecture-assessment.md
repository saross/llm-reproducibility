# Prompt Architecture Assessment: Optimal Structure Analysis

**Question:** Is the current 5-prompt structure optimal, or should prompts be divided/consolidated?

**Approach:** Systematic review considering length, complexity, organic relationships, executor capabilities, and desired outcomes

---

## Current Structure Overview

| Prompt | Lines | Type | Scope | Cognitive Load |
|--------|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| 01 - Claims/Evidence Pass 1 | 337 | Liberal extraction | Section-by-section | HIGH |
| 02 - Claims/Evidence Pass 2 | 425 | Rationalization | Whole-paper | MODERATE |
| 03 - RDMAP Pass 1 | 507 | Liberal extraction | Section-by-section | HIGH |
| 04 - RDMAP Pass 2 | 541 | Rationalization | Whole-paper | MODERATE |
| 05 - Validation Pass 3 | 506 | Validation | Whole-paper | MODERATE |
| **Total** | **2,316 lines** | **5 prompts** | **Mixed** | **Avg: MODERATE-HIGH** |

---

## Analysis by Prompt

### Prompt 01: Claims & Evidence Pass 1 (337 lines)

**Structure:**
- Task definition and philosophy (40 lines)
- Sourcing requirements (50 lines)
- Extraction philosophy (20 lines)
- Core principles (100 lines including 4-level hierarchy, implicit arguments taxonomy)
- Workflow guidance (80 lines)
- Output format and quality checklist (47 lines)

**Execution pattern:**
- Section-by-section iteration (Abstract+Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion)
- Within each section: Extract evidence → Extract claims → Systematic 4-type implicit argument scan
- Save progress after each section group

**Cognitive load factors:**
- HIGH: Must distinguish evidence vs claims while reading
- HIGH: Must run systematic 4-type implicit argument scan for each core claim
- MODERATE: Liberal extraction philosophy (when uncertain, include it)
- MODERATE: Sourcing discipline (verbatim quotes, trigger text)

**Natural subdivision opportunities:**
- Could split: Explicit extraction vs Implicit argument extraction (2 prompts)
- Would create: 01A (Explicit claims/evidence) + 01B (Implicit arguments)
- **Assessment:** NOT RECOMMENDED - breaks holistic section-by-section workflow where you identify core claims and then immediately scan for implicit arguments

**Conclusion:** **Current structure is optimal** - 337 lines is manageable, workflow is coherent

---

### Prompt 02: Claims & Evidence Pass 2 (425 lines)

**Structure:**
- Task definition (30 lines)
- Sourcing discipline reminder (20 lines)
- Quality checklist (20 lines)
- Rationalization philosophy (20 lines)
- Core consolidation principles (150 lines - evidence, claims, implicit arguments patterns)
- Workflow (3-step process: 70 lines)
- Cross-reference repair (60 lines)
- Quality checklist (30 lines)
- Examples (25 lines)

**Execution pattern:**
- Whole-paper review (not section-by-section)
- Step 1: Identify consolidation opportunities across full paper
- Step 2: Execute consolidations with metadata
- Step 3: Systematic implicit argument completeness review (check if any missed)
- Repair cross-references

**Cognitive load factors:**
- MODERATE: Consolidation pattern recognition (which items should merge?)
- MODERATE: Cross-reference integrity maintenance
- MODERATE: Sourcing preservation through consolidation
- LOW: No new extraction, only refinement

**Duplication with Prompt 04:**
- Consolidation philosophy: ~80% overlap
- Quality checklist structure: ~70% overlap
- Source verification: ~90% overlap
- Cross-reference repair: ~60% overlap (different object types but same logic)

**Natural consolidation opportunity:**
- Could merge with Prompt 04 into unified "Pass 2: Rationalization"
- Would eliminate ~150 lines of duplication
- Combined length: ~800 lines
- Structure: Section A (Claims/Evidence consolidation) + Section B (RDMAP consolidation) + Shared cross-reference repair

**Conclusion:** **Viable consolidation candidate** - could merge with Prompt 04, but current separation has benefits (focused consolidation per domain)

---

### Prompt 03: RDMAP Pass 1 (507 lines)

**Structure:**
- Task definition and philosophy (35 lines)
- Sourcing requirements (60 lines)
- Quality checklist (20 lines)
- Extraction philosophy (25 lines)
- Core decision frameworks (80 lines - tier assignment, boundaries)
- Extraction workflow (130 lines - Steps 0-5 including pre-scan, designs, methods, protocols, cross-ref, expected info)
- Key examples (120 lines - 4 detailed examples)
- Output format (20 lines)
- Pass 1 goal summary (17 lines)

**Execution pattern:**
- Section-by-section iteration (Abstract+Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion)
- Within each section: Extract explicit RDMAP → Scan for implicit RDMAP (CURRENTLY BROKEN - see diagnostic)
- Cross-reference at end
- Save progress after each section group

**Cognitive load factors:**
- HIGH: Three-tier hierarchy (WHY vs WHAT vs HOW) decision-making
- HIGH: Explicit vs Implicit status determination
- HIGH: Must populate implicit_metadata for implicit items (4 subfields)
- MODERATE: Liberal extraction philosophy
- MODERATE: Cross-referencing (bidirectional links)

**Current architectural problem:**
- Implicit RDMAP extraction not properly integrated into workflow (diagnosed separately)
- Will be fixed via Phase A/Phase B restructuring (already planned)

**Natural subdivision opportunities:**
- Could split by tier: 03A (Designs), 03B (Methods), 03C (Protocols)
- Would create 3 prompts from 1
- **Assessment:** NOT RECOMMENDED - three-tier hierarchy requires understanding relationships between tiers, splitting would break holistic understanding

**Conclusion:** **Current structure is optimal after implicit RDMAP fixes** - 507 lines is substantial but necessary for three-tier complexity

---

### Prompt 04: RDMAP Pass 2 (541 lines)

**Structure:**
- Task definition (30 lines)
- Sourcing discipline reminder (20 lines)
- Quality checklist (30 lines)
- Rationalization philosophy (20 lines)
- Core consolidation principles (180 lines - designs, methods, protocols patterns)
- Workflow (4-step process: 90 lines)
- Cross-reference repair (80 lines - more complex than claims due to three-tier hierarchy)
- Examples (60 lines)
- Output format (20 lines)
- Pass 2 goal summary (11 lines)

**Execution pattern:**
- Whole-paper review (not section-by-section)
- Step 1: Review for under-extraction (Research Design count check)
- Step 2: Identify consolidation opportunities across full RDMAP
- Step 3: Execute consolidations with metadata
- Step 4: Validate and repair cross-references (three-tier hierarchy)

**Cognitive load factors:**
- MODERATE: RDMAP consolidation pattern recognition
- MODERATE-HIGH: Three-tier hierarchy cross-reference maintenance
- MODERATE: Sourcing preservation (explicit and implicit)
- MODERATE: Tier assignment verification (consolidation can change tier)

**Duplication with Prompt 02:**
- Consolidation philosophy: ~80% overlap (same principles, different objects)
- Quality checklist structure: ~70% overlap
- Source verification: ~90% overlap
- Cross-reference repair: ~60% overlap (logic similar but three-tier vs two-tier)

**Unique complexity:**
- Three-tier hierarchy cross-references more complex than claims/evidence
- Status field management (explicit/implicit) adds cognitive load
- Research Design count check (3-10 expected range) unique to RDMAP

**Natural consolidation opportunity:**
- Could merge with Prompt 02 into unified "Pass 2: Rationalization"
- Benefits: Eliminate duplication, unified consolidation philosophy
- Risks: ~800-line prompt, mixing claims and RDMAP mental models

**Conclusion:** **Viable consolidation candidate** - but current separation allows focused RDMAP consolidation without claims context interference

---

### Prompt 05: Validation Pass 3 (506 lines)

**Structure:**
- Task definition (30 lines)
- Critical read verification procedures reminder (15 lines)
- Validation checklist (40 lines)
- Validation philosophy (25 lines)
- Validation checks (260 lines):
  - Cross-reference integrity
  - Hierarchy validation
  - Schema compliance
  - Source verification (hallucination detection)
  - Expected information review
  - Consolidation metadata checks
- Output format (80 lines - JSON report structure)
- Quality metrics (40 lines)
- Examples (16 lines)

**Execution pattern:**
- Whole-paper validation (single pass)
- Already handles both claims/evidence AND RDMAP validation
- Flexible: validates whatever object types are present
- Systematic checking against verification procedures

**Cognitive load factors:**
- MODERATE: Systematic checking against checklists (lower creativity needed)
- MODERATE: Cross-reference validation (three-tier hierarchy complexity)
- LOW-MODERATE: Schema compliance (mechanical checking)
- MODERATE: Source verification (requires reading paper to verify quotes)

**Already unified:**
- Validates claims, evidence, implicit arguments, AND RDMAP in single pass
- Demonstrates that unified validation is feasible and effective

**Natural subdivision opportunities:**
- Could split: Structural validation vs Source verification (2 prompts)
- Would create: 05A (Structure/schema/cross-refs) + 05B (Source verification)
- **Assessment:** NOT RECOMMENDED - validation should be holistic, structural issues often relate to sourcing issues

**Conclusion:** **Current unified structure is optimal** - demonstrates that validation across object types works well in single prompt

---

## Architectural Patterns Analysis

### Pattern 1: Pass 1 Prompts (Liberal Extraction)

**Current:** Separate prompts for Claims/Evidence (01) and RDMAP (03)

**Rationale for separation:**
- Different mental models: Claims/Evidence (reasoning structure) vs RDMAP (methodology structure)
- Different object types: 3 arrays vs 3 arrays
- Different taxonomies: 4-level claim hierarchy vs 3-tier RDMAP hierarchy
- Different implicit extraction: 4-type implicit arguments vs 4-pattern implicit RDMAP

**Could they be unified?**
- Theoretical: Yes, could create single "Pass 1: Liberal Extraction" prompt
- Practical: Would be ~850+ lines, mixing claims and methods mental models
- Execution: Section-by-section would require switching between claims-thinking and methods-thinking within each section
- **Assessment:** NOT RECOMMENDED - separation maintains focused mental models

**Conclusion:** **Separation is optimal** - different enough to warrant separate prompts

---

### Pattern 2: Pass 2 Prompts (Rationalization)

**Current:** Separate prompts for Claims/Evidence (02) and RDMAP (04)

**Rationale for separation:**
- Different consolidation patterns (claims vs methods vs protocols)
- Different cross-reference structures (bidirectional vs three-tier)
- Different object types with different fields

**Duplication analysis:**
- Consolidation philosophy: ~150 lines duplicated (80% overlap)
- Quality approach: ~50 lines duplicated
- Source verification: ~40 lines duplicated
- Cross-reference principles: ~60 lines duplicated (60% overlap)
- **Total duplication: ~300 lines across both prompts**

**Could they be unified?**
- Structure: "Pass 2: Rationalization" with Section A (Claims) + Section B (RDMAP)
- Would eliminate ~200-250 lines of duplication (after accounting for integration overhead)
- Combined length: ~650-750 lines (currently 425 + 541 = 966, minus 200-250 duplication = ~700)
- Execution: Whole-paper review already, could do claims first then RDMAP
- Mental model: Consolidation principles are universal, just applied to different objects

**Benefits of unification:**
- Eliminates duplication (DRY principle)
- Unified consolidation philosophy
- Single quality standard
- Unified cross-reference repair at end (can repair claims→methods links in one pass)

**Risks of unification:**
- Longer prompt (~700 lines)
- Context switching between claims and RDMAP within single prompt
- May increase cognitive load (mixing two domains)

**Assessment:** **VIABLE BUT NOT NECESSARILY BETTER**
- Current separation: 966 lines total, but focused domains
- Unified: ~700 lines, but mixed domains
- Trade-off: Length reduction vs cognitive load increase

**Conclusion:** **Either structure defensible** - current separation is slightly preferable for focused consolidation, but unification would eliminate duplication

---

### Pattern 3: Pass 3 Validation (Already Unified)

**Current:** Single prompt validates both claims/evidence AND RDMAP

**Why this works:**
- Validation is mechanical/systematic (lower cognitive load than extraction)
- Validation principles are universal across object types
- Cross-references BETWEEN claims and RDMAP require unified validation
- Schema compliance checks are same process regardless of object type

**Success of unified validation suggests:**
- Unification works when task is systematic/mechanical
- Unification works when integration is required (cross-domain references)
- Unification can handle ~500 lines without cognitive overload

**Implication for Pass 2:**
- If validation can be unified at 506 lines...
- Then rationalization could theoretically be unified at ~700 lines
- Key question: Is rationalization systematic enough to benefit from unification?

## Alternative Architectures Considered

### Option A: Current Structure (5 prompts)

```
01: Claims/Evidence Pass 1 (337 lines)
02: Claims/Evidence Pass 2 (425 lines)
03: RDMAP Pass 1 (507 lines)
04: RDMAP Pass 2 (541 lines)
05: Validation Pass 3 (506 lines)
Total: 2,316 lines across 5 prompts
```

**Strengths:**
- Focused prompts with clear boundaries
- Separate mental models for claims vs RDMAP
- Parallel structure (easy to understand workflow)
- Already working (implicit RDMAP issue is execution, not structure)

**Weaknesses:**
- Duplication in Pass 2 prompts (~300 lines)
- 5 prompts creates more context switching
- Consolidation principles repeated

---

### Option B: Consolidate Pass 2 (4 prompts)

```
01: Claims/Evidence Pass 1 (337 lines)
02: Unified Rationalization (700 lines)
    - Section A: Claims/Evidence consolidation
    - Section B: RDMAP consolidation
    - Section C: Cross-reference repair
03: RDMAP Pass 1 (507 lines)
04: Validation Pass 3 (506 lines)
Total: ~2,050 lines across 4 prompts
```

**Strengths:**
- Eliminates duplication (~250 lines saved)
- Unified consolidation philosophy
- Single quality standard
- Unified cross-reference repair
- Fewer prompts (4 vs 5)

**Weaknesses:**
- Longer Pass 2 prompt (~700 lines)
- Mixed claims/RDMAP context in single prompt
- May increase cognitive load during execution
- Workflow slightly less intuitive (Pass 1 claims → Pass 1 RDMAP → Pass 2 unified)

---

### Option C: Split Explicit/Implicit Extraction (7 prompts)

```
01A: Claims/Evidence Explicit (200 lines)
01B: Implicit Arguments Systematic Scan (200 lines)
02: Claims/Evidence Pass 2 (425 lines)
03A: RDMAP Explicit (300 lines)
03B: RDMAP Implicit Systematic Scan (250 lines)
04: RDMAP Pass 2 (541 lines)
05: Validation Pass 3 (506 lines)
Total: ~2,400 lines across 7 prompts
```

**Strengths:**
- Focused prompts (explicit vs implicit separation)
- Could emphasize implicit extraction more clearly

**Weaknesses:**
- Too fragmented (7 prompts)
- Breaks section-by-section workflow cohesion
- More context switching
- Explicit extraction requires understanding implicit context anyway
- Would increase total line count

**Assessment:** **NOT RECOMMENDED** - excessive fragmentation

---

### Option D: Split by RDMAP Tier (6 prompts)

```
01: Claims/Evidence Pass 1 (337 lines)
02: Claims/Evidence Pass 2 (425 lines)
03A: Research Designs Pass 1 (250 lines)
03B: Methods Pass 1 (200 lines)
03C: Protocols Pass 1 (200 lines)
04: RDMAP Pass 2 (541 lines)
05: Validation Pass 3 (506 lines)
Total: ~2,450 lines across 6 prompts
```

**Strengths:**
- Focused tier extraction

**Weaknesses:**
- Breaks three-tier hierarchy understanding
- Cross-referencing requires understanding relationships across tiers
- Would need to pass between prompts multiple times per section
- More fragmentation

**Assessment:** **NOT RECOMMENDED** - hierarchy understanding is critical

---

## Cognitive Load Analysis

### Peak Cognitive Load Points

**Highest load:**
1. **Prompt 03 (RDMAP Pass 1)**: Three-tier hierarchy + explicit/implicit + liberal extraction + sourcing
2. **Prompt 01 (Claims Pass 1)**: Evidence/claim distinction + 4-level hierarchy + implicit arguments + liberal extraction

**Moderate load:**
3. **Prompt 04 (RDMAP Pass 2)**: Three-tier consolidation + cross-reference repair
4. **Prompt 02 (Claims Pass 2)**: Consolidation patterns + cross-reference repair
5. **Prompt 05 (Validation)**: Systematic checking (mechanical but thorough)

### Can Peak Load Be Reduced?

**For Prompt 03 (RDMAP):**
- Current: 507 lines covering WHY/WHAT/HOW + explicit/implicit
- Could split by tier: 3 prompts of ~200 lines each
- **BUT:** Understanding WHY→WHAT→HOW relationships requires seeing all three tiers
- **Conclusion:** Load is inherent to task complexity, not prompt structure

**For Prompt 01 (Claims):**
- Current: 337 lines covering evidence/claims + implicit arguments
- Could split: Explicit (200 lines) + Implicit (200 lines)
- **BUT:** Implicit argument scanning requires understanding which claims are core (from explicit extraction)
- **Conclusion:** Load is necessary, splitting would break workflow cohesion

### Load Management Through Execution

**Current workflow handles load through:**
- Section-by-section execution (natural break points)
- Save progress after each section group
- Auto-compact between sections if needed
- Checkpoint validation after writes

**This is working well** - execution pattern manages cognitive load effectively

---

## Executor Capability Assessment

As the executor, I can effectively handle:

**Token budget:**
- Current longest prompt: 541 lines (~4,000-5,000 tokens with formatting)
- With paper content: ~15,000-25,000 tokens per section group
- Within my 200K token budget with substantial headroom

**Complexity management:**
- Three-tier hierarchy: Manageable with careful cross-reference tracking
- Explicit/implicit distinction: Clear decision rules work well
- Liberal extraction: Philosophy is clear when properly emphasized
- Consolidation patterns: Well-defined, easy to apply

**Issues encountered:**
- **Implicit RDMAP extraction failure**: Workflow integration problem, NOT prompt length problem
- **Conservative extraction**: Execution discipline problem, NOT structural problem

**Optimal prompt characteristics for me:**
1. **Clear workflow steps with checkpoints** ✅ Current structure has this
2. **Explicit iteration instructions** ✅ Works for implicit arguments, missing for implicit RDMAP (being fixed)
3. **Quality gates, not just checklists** ⚠️ Some prompts have this, others need improvement
4. **Examples embedded in prompt** ✅ Current prompts have good examples
5. **Reasonable length (< 600 lines)** ✅ All prompts within range

**Conclusion:** Current 5-prompt structure is well within my capabilities. Problems are execution/emphasis issues, not structural issues.

---

## Organic Relationship Analysis

### Natural Task Boundaries

**Strong boundaries (should NOT merge):**
1. **Pass 1 Claims vs Pass 1 RDMAP**: Different mental models (reasoning vs methodology)
2. **Pass 1 vs Pass 2**: Different philosophies (liberal vs conservative, extraction vs refinement)
3. **Pass 2 vs Pass 3**: Different purposes (refinement vs validation)

**Weak boundaries (could merge):**
1. **Pass 2 Claims vs Pass 2 RDMAP**: Same philosophy (consolidation), different objects
2. ~~Pass 1 Explicit vs Pass 1 Implicit~~: Too interdependent, must stay together

### Workflow Cohesion

**Section-by-section passes (01, 03):**
- Extract explicit content
- Scan for implicit content
- Save progress
- Move to next section
- **Cohesion is high within each section** - splitting would break this

**Whole-paper passes (02, 04, 05):**
- Review full extraction
- Apply consolidation or validation
- Repair cross-references
- **Cohesion is high within each pass** - but Pass 2 prompts could theoretically merge

### Integration Points

**Key integration moments:**
- **Claims ↔ Evidence**: Bidirectional references, validated in Pass 2 and Pass 3
- **Claims ↔ Methods**: Justification links, requires both domains visible
- **Evidence ↔ Protocols**: Produces links, requires both domains visible
- **Design → Methods → Protocols**: Three-tier hierarchy, requires whole RDMAP visible

**Implication:**
- Pass 3 validation MUST be unified (already is) ✅
- Pass 2 rationalization SHOULD have visibility across claims and RDMAP for cross-reference repair
- Current structure handles this by having separate Pass 2 prompts but assumes cross-references will be repaired in each

**Potential issue with current structure:**
- Pass 2 Claims repairs claim→method references
- Pass 2 RDMAP repairs method→claim references
- But they run separately - could create inconsistency

**Unified Pass 2 would solve this:**
- Repair all cross-references in single pass with full visibility
- Eliminate bidirectional inconsistencies

---

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: **Keep Current 5-Prompt Structure**

**Rationale:**
1. **Separation of concerns works well**: Claims vs RDMAP are different enough to warrant focused prompts
2. **Section-by-section cohesion**: Pass 1 prompts maintain workflow integrity
3. **Length is manageable**: All prompts < 550 lines, well within executor capability
4. **Problems are execution, not structure**: Implicit RDMAP failure is workflow integration, not prompt architecture

**Implementation:**
- Fix implicit RDMAP integration in Prompt 03 (already planned)
- Improve liberal extraction execution (already planned)
- Add quality gates to Pass 2 prompts (replace checklists)
- **No structural changes needed**

### Alternative Recommendation: **Consolidate Pass 2 (4-Prompt Structure)**

**If duplication is primary concern**, consider:

**Structure:**
```
Pass 1: Claims/Evidence Liberal Extraction (337 lines)
Pass 2: RDMAP Liberal Extraction (507 lines)
Pass 3: Unified Rationalization (700 lines)
    Section A: Claims/Evidence Consolidation
    Section B: RDMAP Consolidation
    Section C: Unified Cross-Reference Repair
Pass 4: Validation (506 lines)
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates ~250 lines of duplication
- Unified consolidation philosophy
- Single cross-reference repair with full visibility
- Cleaner conceptual model (extract → rationalize → validate)

**Costs:**
- Longer Pass 3 prompt (~700 lines)
- Mixed claims/RDMAP context during rationalization
- Slight increase in cognitive load during Pass 3 execution

**Assessment:** **Viable alternative, but not clearly superior to current structure**

### Not Recommended: Other Architectures

**Do NOT:**
- Split explicit/implicit extraction (breaks workflow cohesion)
- Split RDMAP by tier (breaks hierarchy understanding)
- Create more than 6 prompts (excessive fragmentation)

---

## Implementation Guidance

### If Keeping Current 5-Prompt Structure (RECOMMENDED):

**Priority fixes:**
1. ✅ Fix implicit RDMAP integration (Phase A/B structure - already planned)
2. ✅ Improve liberal extraction emphasis (already planned)
3. Add quality gates to Pass 2 prompts:
   - Replace "Status fields set for all items" checkboxes
   - Add "Demonstrate consolidation opportunities reviewed" gates
4. Add consolidation rate checks to Pass 2 prompts:
   - "If consolidation rate < 15%, document why"
5. Consider adding cross-reference validation to Pass 2 prompts:
   - "Verify bidirectional consistency after consolidations"

**Do NOT change prompt count or structure**

### If Consolidating Pass 2 to 4-Prompt Structure:

**Implementation steps:**
1. Create new prompt: `02-unified_pass2_rationalization_prompt.md`
2. Structure:
   - Section A: Claims/Evidence Rationalization (~200 lines from current 02)
   - Section B: RDMAP Rationalization (~250 lines from current 04)
   - Section C: Unified Cross-Reference Repair (~100 lines - new, comprehensive)
   - Shared: Consolidation philosophy (~150 lines - deduplicated)
3. Renumber remaining prompts (03→02, 04→03)
4. Test thoroughly on multiple papers
5. Compare consolidation quality vs current structure

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 hours (creation + testing)

---

## Summary

**Answer to "Is 5-prompt structure optimal?"**

**Yes, the current 5-prompt structure is near-optimal.**

**Key findings:**
1. ✅ Prompt lengths manageable (337-541 lines, all < 550)
2. ✅ Natural task boundaries respected (extraction vs rationalization vs validation)
3. ✅ Separation of concerns works well (claims vs RDMAP mental models)
4. ✅ Section-by-section workflow cohesion maintained
5. ✅ Executor capabilities well-matched to structure
6. ⚠️ Some duplication in Pass 2 prompts (~300 lines) - could consolidate but not essential
7. ❌ Main issues are execution (implicit RDMAP, liberal extraction) - NOT structural

**The problems we've identified (implicit RDMAP, conservative extraction) stem from:**
- Workflow integration gaps (Phase A/B separation needed)
- Execution emphasis (liberal philosophy not strong enough)
- Quality gates (checklists vs required scan evidence)

**These are NOT architectural problems requiring prompt restructuring.**

**Recommendation:**
- **Keep current 5-prompt structure**
- **Implement planned implicit RDMAP fixes** (workflow integration)
- **Implement planned liberal extraction improvements** (execution emphasis)
- **Consider Pass 2 consolidation as future optimization** (reduce duplication), but not required

The architecture is sound. Focus on fixing the execution issues we've already diagnosed.

---

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Assessment:** Current 5-prompt structure is optimal
**Primary issue:** Execution/emphasis, not architecture
