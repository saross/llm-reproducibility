## Corpus-Level Observations

### Homogeneity vs Heterogeneity

**Overall homogeneity:** Moderate. Papers show some variation but cluster around typical values.

**Low-variance metrics (CV < 0.1):** TCI
- These metrics show little variation across corpus. May not be discriminating in this sample.

## Interpretation Notes

### Limitations of This Corpus Profile

- **Small sample (n=10)**: Statistics are unstable. Percentiles may shift dramatically with additional papers.
- **No ground truth**: Metrics not validated against external quality assessments. High scores may reflect extraction quality, not research quality.
- **Corpus-specific patterns**: Observations may not generalise to other domains, genres, or time periods.
- **Extraction dependency**: All metrics depend on extraction quality and granularity decisions.

### Using This Profile

This profile should be used to:

1. **Understand corpus characteristics** before interpreting individual paper scores
2. **Identify metrics with good discriminating power** (high variance) vs poor power (low variance)
3. **Calibrate expectations** for what constitutes "typical" vs "exceptional" scores
4. **Compare corpora** (if multiple corpus profiles generated)
5. **Inform metric refinement** (identify problematic metrics needing adjustment)

Do NOT use this profile to:

- Make definitive claims about research quality
- Compare papers from different corpora without controlling for corpus characteristics
- Treat corpus means as universal quality thresholds
