# RDMAP Prompts Correction Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Schema Version:** 2.4 ‚Üí 2.5  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL CORRECTIONS COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully corrected all three RDMAP prompts (Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3) to fix sourcing section errors and implement schema v2.5 updates. The primary issue was that sourcing guidance was copied from Claims/Evidence prompts and referenced the wrong object types. All corrections verified against checklist.

**Files produced:**
1. `rdmap_pass1_prompt_v2.5.md` - Liberal Extraction
2. `rdmap_pass2_prompt_v2.5.md` - Rationalization  
3. `rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md` - Validation

## Phase 1: RDMAP Pass 1 Corrections (~20 minutes)

### 1.1 Header Updates
**Changed:**
- Version: 2.4 ‚Üí 2.5
- Last Updated: 2025-10-20 ‚Üí 2025-10-21
- **Added:** Schema Update note about mandatory sourcing

**Result:**
```markdown
**Version:** 2.5 Pass 1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Schema Update:** Added mandatory sourcing (explicit/implicit distinction) to prevent hallucination
```

### 1.2 COMPLETE REPLACEMENT: Sourcing Section

**‚ùå Old (WRONG - copied from Claims/Evidence):**
- Discussed Evidence, Claims, Implicit Arguments
- Referenced `verbatim_quote` for evidence
- Referenced `trigger_text` for implicit arguments
- No mention of Research Designs, Methods, Protocols

**‚úÖ New (CORRECT - for RDMAP):**
- New section: "üö® CRITICAL: Source-Based Extraction (Schema v2.5)"
- Discusses Research Designs, Methods, Protocols specifically
- Explains explicit vs implicit RDMAP items
- Decision tree for status classification
- Complete field requirements for both explicit and implicit
- Hallucination prevention guidance

**Added subsections:**
- Explicit vs Implicit RDMAP
- Explicit RDMAP Extraction (with verbatim_quote)
- Implicit RDMAP Extraction (with trigger_text + implicit_metadata)
- Hallucination Prevention

### 1.3 NEW SECTION: Status Field Guidance

**Added after three-tier framework (Section 2):**
- "Explicit vs Implicit Status (NEW in v2.5)"
- Decision tree for classifying RDMAP items
- Basis classification: mentioned_undocumented vs inferred_from_results
- Examples of each status type
- Note about implicit not meaning "bad methodology"
- Clarification: expected_information vs implicit status relationship

### 1.4 Quality Checklist Additions

**Added 5 new checklist items:**
- ‚úÖ Status fields set for all RDMAP items (explicit or implicit)
- ‚úÖ All explicit items have verbatim_quote populated
- ‚úÖ All implicit items have trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning
- ‚úÖ All implicit items have complete implicit_metadata
- ‚úÖ No hallucinations - only extract what's sourced

### 1.5 NEW EXAMPLES

**Added two new comprehensive examples:**

**Example 4: Implicit Method (mentioned_undocumented)**
- Shows method mentioned in Discussion but not documented in Methods
- Complete trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning
- Full implicit_metadata object
- Expected information gaps listed

**Example 5: Implicit Protocol (inferred_from_results)**
- Shows protocol inferred from Results section
- Demonstrates "inferred_from_results" basis
- Lower reconstruction_confidence due to less explicit triggers

**Updated existing examples:**
- All examples now show explicit status
- All examples include verbatim_quote field
- All examples include location objects

### 1.6 Expected Information Note

**Added clarification:**
- Expected information is separate from implicit status
- Explicit methods can still be missing expected details
- Implicit methods automatically have higher gaps
- Don't treat implicit as "failure"

### 1.7 Output Format Updates

**Changed:**
- Schema version: 2.4 ‚Üí 2.5
- **Added to extraction_notes:**
  - `explicit_items`: count
  - `implicit_items`: count

## Phase 2: RDMAP Pass 2 Corrections (~15 minutes)

### 2.1 Header Updates
**Changed:**
- Version: 2.4 ‚Üí 2.5
- Last Updated: 2025-10-20 ‚Üí 2025-10-21
- **Added:** Schema Update note about source verification for consolidations

**Result:**
```markdown
**Version:** 2.5 Pass 2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21

```

### 2.2 Schema Reference Update
**Changed:**
- `"schema_version": "2.4"` ‚Üí `"2.5"` in output format

### 2.3 NEW SECTION: Source Verification for Consolidations

**Added after STEP 2 in Consolidation Workflow:**

**Section: "üö® Source Verification for Consolidations (v2.5)"**

**For explicit items:**
- Ensure consolidated verbatim_quote preserves/synthesizes source text
- All quotes from same general location (Methods)
- Don't claim beyond quotes
- Flag conflicts in consolidation_metadata

**For implicit items:**
- Preserve all trigger_text passages
- Update trigger_locations to include all sources
- Update inference_reasoning for consolidated understanding
- Maintain most conservative reconstruction_confidence

**Adding implicit RDMAP in Pass 2:**
- Cross-subsection synthesis patterns
- Overlooked implicit content
- Comparative designs
- Requirements when adding (trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning, implicit_metadata)
- Must explain why missed in Pass 1

**Reference to verification-procedures.md added**

### 2.4 Quality Checklist Additions

**Added 4 new checklist items:**
- ‚úÖ Source verification complete for consolidations
- ‚úÖ Status fields preserved/corrected after consolidation
- ‚úÖ Explicit items maintain verbatim_quote integrity
- ‚úÖ Implicit items maintain trigger_text integrity

---

## Phase 3: Pass 3 Validation Corrections (~15 minutes)

### 3.1 Header Update

**Changed:**
```markdown
**Update:** Added source verification checks (hallucination prevention)
```

**To:**
```markdown
**Update:** Added source verification checks for ALL object types including RDMAP (hallucination prevention)
```

**Clarifies:** RDMAP source verification is now included, not just Evidence/Claims

### 3.2 NEW CHECK: 4.5 RDMAP Source Verification

**Added comprehensive new section after Check 4.4:**

**Section: "Check 4.5: RDMAP Source Verification (NEW in v2.5)"**

**Contents:**
- üö® CRITICAL notice that RDMAP requires same sourcing as Evidence/Claims
- Requirements for explicit RDMAP items (verbatim_quote + source_verification object)
- Requirements for implicit RDMAP items (trigger_text + trigger_locations + inference_reasoning + implicit_metadata + source_verification object)
- Verification procedures for explicit RDMAP (3 steps)
- Verification procedures for implicit RDMAP (5 steps)
- Report format for critical issues (rdmap_source_issues array)
- Pass rate calculations per tier
- Reference to verification-procedures.md

**Field verifications added:**
- location_verified, quote_verified, content_aligned (explicit)
- trigger_locations_verified, trigger_quotes_verified, inference_reasonable (implicit)
- verification_notes, verified_by for both types

### 3.3 EXPANDED: Check 4.3 Statistical Metrics

**Old version:**
- Only Evidence & Claims metrics
- Only Implicit Arguments metrics
- Generic pass rates

**New version (EXPANDED for v2.5):**

**Added RDMAP metrics section:**
- Research Designs: explicit pass rate, implicit pass rate, overall
- Methods: explicit pass rate, implicit pass rate, overall
- Protocols: explicit pass rate, implicit pass rate, overall
- Combined RDMAP: overall sourcing quality across all three tiers

**Added example JSON structure showing:**
```json
"rdmap": {
  "research_designs": {
    "explicit": {"total": 5, "passed": 5, "pass_rate": 100},
    "implicit": {"total": 1, "passed": 1, "pass_rate": 100},
    "overall": {"total": 6, "passed": 6, "pass_rate": 100}
  },
  // ... similar for methods and protocols
  "rdmap_overall": {
    "total": 52,
    "passed": 49,
    "pass_rate": 94.2,
    "status": "warning"
  }
}
```

### 3.4 NEW NOTE: Expected Information vs Implicit Status

**Added in Section 5, Check 4.1 (Aggregate Missing Information):**

**Note: "Note on implicit status vs expected information"**

**Clarifies:**
- These are related but distinct concepts
- Status field tracks whether RDMAP is documented in Methods
- expected_information_missing tracks completeness of documentation
- Explicit methods can still be missing expected information
- Implicit methods automatically have higher expected gaps
- Don't treat implicit status as a "failure" - it documents transparency gaps
