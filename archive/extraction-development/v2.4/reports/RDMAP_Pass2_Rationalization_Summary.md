# RDMAP Pass 2 Rationalization Summary
## Sobotkova et al. 2023 - Methods Section

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Pass:** RDMAP Pass 2 (Rationalization)  
**Section:** Methods (Section 2: subsections 2.1-2.5)  
**Approach:** Conservative consolidation with complete information preservation

---

## Rationalization Results

### Overall Reduction: 7.4% (27 → 25 items)

**Research Designs:** 5 → 5 (no change)
**Methods:** 7 → 7 (no change)
**Protocols:** 15 → 13 (-2 items)

### Consolidations Performed: 2

#### Consolidation 1: System Preparation Workflow
**From:** P009 (System setup) + P010 (Map preparation)  
**To:** P009 (System preparation workflow)  
**Type:** `workflow_integration`  
**Rationale:** Sequential steps in same preparation workflow assessed together

**Preserved information:**
- 2017 timing: 3h setup + 4h map prep = 7h total
- 2018 timing: 1h setup + 2h map prep = 3h total  
- All activities: server config, client config, tiling, pyramids, compression, upload, download
- Year-over-year efficiency improvements documented

**Assessment question:** "Was the system adequately prepared for field deployment?"

#### Consolidation 2: Interface Design Specifications  
**From:** P012 (Dual view system) + P013 (Control minimization)  
**To:** P012 (Interface design specifications)  
**Type:** `parameter_integration`  
**Rationale:** Complementary aspects of unified interface design approach

**Preserved information:**
- Dual-view system: map view + form view with toggle
- Map view functions: layer control, pan, zoom, shape digitisation
- Form view functions: attribute creation/editing
- Exposed controls: 5 essential control types
- Hidden functions: non-digitisation GIS features
- Staff-only functions: infrastructure, export, backup
- Design principles: minimize cognitive load, strip to essentials

**Assessment question:** "Was the interface design appropriate for novice users?"

## Reduction Below Target (7.4% vs 15-20%)

### Why This Is Appropriate:

1. **Well-scoped Pass 1:** Methods section extraction was already appropriately granular, minimal over-extraction

2. **Assessment granularity:** Each remaining RDMAP item represents a distinct assessment concern:
   - Research Designs: 5 distinct strategic decisions
   - Methods: 7 distinct tactical approaches
   - Protocols: 13 distinct operational procedures

3. **Acid test applied rigorously:** Only consolidated items that would be assessed together

4. **Section type variation:** Pass 2 prompt acknowledges "may vary by section type"

5. **Better to preserve appropriate granularity than force consolidations**

### Items That Were NOT Consolidated (And Why):

**Research Designs (all kept separate):**
- RD001 (research goal) vs RD002 (crowdsourcing decision): Different strategic concerns
- RD002 (crowdsourcing) vs RD003 (mobile platform): Different decision domains
- RD003 (platform) vs RD004 (division of labor): Different design aspects
- All assessed separately for rationale adequacy

**Methods (all kept separate):**
- M001 (feature identification) vs M002 (crowdsourcing): Different data collection approaches
- M003 (platform selection) vs M004 (customization): Selection vs development
- M006 (time tracking) vs M007 (error sampling): Different evaluation methods
- All assessed separately for appropriateness

**Protocols (11 kept separate after 2 consolidations):**
- P001 (map specs) vs P002 (target specs): Different specification domains
- P003 (training) vs P004 (supervision): One-time vs ongoing
- P007 (development) vs P008 (workflow): Who vs stages
- P011 (automation): Unique system capabilities
- Each has distinct replication-critical details

## Key Features of Pass 2 Rationalization

### 1. Conservative Consolidation Philosophy
- Applied acid test rigorously: "Assess together or separately?"
- Only consolidated sequential workflows and complementary design principles
- Preserved all quantitative values and replication-critical details
- Better to under-consolidate than lose information

### 2. Complete Traceability
- All consolidations documented with full metadata
- `consolidated_from` arrays preserve original item IDs
- `consolidation_type` classifies consolidation pattern
- `information_preserved: complete` verified for both consolidations
- `rationale` explains assessment logic

### 3. Cross-Reference Integrity
- Fixed 6 cross-reference issues after consolidation:
  - Added missing Design→Method reverse references (4 fixes)
  - Removed references to consolidated protocols (2 fixes)
- All Design↔Method and Method↔Protocol links now bidirectional
- Cross-reference chains traceable from strategic to operational level

### 4. Tier Assignment Verification
- All 5 Research Designs verified as WHY (strategic)
- All 7 Methods verified as WHAT (tactical)
- All 13 Protocols verified as HOW (operational)
- No tier corrections needed

### 5. Boundary Accuracy Maintained
- Methods section is methodological description (RDMAP)
- No argumentative claims mixed into RDMAP arrays
- Clear separation: describing vs arguing

## Pass 2 Decisions and Rationale

### Decision 1: Below-Target Reduction Acceptable
**Context:** 7.4% vs 15-20% target  
**Rationale:** Pass 1 was well-scoped; forcing additional consolidations would compromise appropriate granularity  
**Outcome:** Preserved 25 distinct RDMAP items, each representing separate assessment concern

### Decision 2: Focus Protocol Consolidations
**Context:** Designs and Methods unchanged, Protocols reduced  
**Rationale:** Higher-tier items (Designs, Methods) already at appropriate abstraction level; Protocol-level had sequential workflows to integrate  
**Outcome:** 2 protocol consolidations (preparation workflow, interface design)

### Decision 3: Complete Information Preservation
**Context:** All consolidations marked "information_preserved: complete"  
**Rationale:** Prioritize no information loss over aggressive reduction  
**Outcome:** All quantitative values, activities, and specifications preserved

### Decision 4: Rigorous Cross-Reference Validation
**Context:** Consolidated protocols required cross-reference updates  
**Rationale:** Maintain bidirectional consistency for traceability  
**Outcome:** 6 cross-reference fixes applied, all links now valid

## Ready for Pass 3 Validation

The extraction is **ready for RDMAP Pass 3 (validation)**.

### Pass 3 Will Focus On:
1. **Structural integrity checks** across all arrays
2. **Cross-reference consistency** between RDMAP and Claims/Evidence
3. **Completeness verification** (no missing critical information)
4. **Boundary accuracy** final validation
5. **Assessment-ready confirmation** (can all items be independently evaluated?)

### Expected Pass 3 Outcome:
- **Validation report** (no modifications to extraction)
- **Quality metrics** (completeness, consistency, traceability)
- **Assessment readiness** confirmation
- **Flagged issues** (if any) for manual review

## Assessment Implications

The rationalized extraction enables assessment of:

### Transparency (Are methods clearly described?)
- Each Research Design: rationale adequacy, scope clarity
- Each Method: approach specification, justification
- Each Protocol: replication-critical detail, parameter values

### Replicability (Could someone replicate the study?)
- Research Designs: study framing reproducible?
- Methods: approaches implementable?
- Protocols: sufficient procedural detail?

### Credibility (Are methods appropriate?)
- Research Designs: reasoning approach sound?
- Methods: sampling/collection approaches valid?
- Protocols: tools/parameters appropriate?

### Each RDMAP item can be independently evaluated for these dimensions.
