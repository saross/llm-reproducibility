## What You Asked For vs What We Delivered

### Your Requirements ✅

1. **"Extract complete sentences only"**  
   ✅ Rule #1 in verbatim requirements: "Extract complete grammatical units"

2. **"Fix paraphrasing problem"**  
   ✅ Rule #2: "Copy-paste only, no paraphrasing" with detection examples

3. **"Add as little as possible to prompts"**  
   ✅ Only ~100 tokens per prompt, detailed guidance in skill

4. **"Leverage skill slack"**  
   ✅ 3,500-token reference file loaded on-demand, not always in context

5. **"Semi-automated LLM-based pipeline"**  
   ✅ Verification script automates detection, LLM still does extraction

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Skill Updates (COMPLETE)

**Files created:**
- `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md` ✅
- `references/extraction-fundamentals.md` (updated) ✅
- `scripts/verify_quotes.py` ✅
- `prompt_modification_guide.md` ✅

**Status:** Ready to use immediately

---

### 📋 Phase 2: Prompt Updates (READY TO DEPLOY)

**What to do:**

1. **Update Claims Pass 1 Prompt**
   - Open your claims extraction Pass 1 prompt file
   - After task description, before extraction instructions, add:
   
   ```markdown
   ## 🚨 CRITICAL: Verbatim Quote Requirements
   
   **Before extracting any item, read:**  
   `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`
   
   **Non-negotiable rules:**
   1. **Extract complete sentences only** - No mid-sentence fragments
   2. **Copy-paste exact text** - No paraphrasing or reconstruction  
   3. **Verify quote exists** - Search paper before committing to JSON
   4. **Single source location** - No synthesizing from multiple passages
   
   **Quick test:** "Can I find this exact text with simple search?"
   - If NO → Fix quote or mark as implicit
   - If YES → Proceed with extraction
   
   **Failure to follow these rules causes 40-50% validation failures and blocks assessment.**
   ```

2. **Update RDMAP Pass 1 Prompt**
   - Same addition as above

3. **Update Claims Pass 2 Prompt**
   - In consolidation workflow section, add verification step:
   
   ```markdown
   ### Step 4: Source Verification (NEW)
   
   **Before finalizing consolidations, verify all quotes:**
   
   For each item being kept:
   1. Check verbatim_quote follows requirements in `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`
   2. Search for exact quote in paper
   3. If quote not found → Locate actual text and update
   4. If quote is paraphrased → Replace with true verbatim text
   5. If quote is synthesized → Split into separate items
   
   **Common fixes needed:**
   - Add missing sentence beginnings/endings
   - Replace paraphrases with exact text
   - Split multi-source quotes into separate items
   ```

4. **Update RDMAP Pass 2 Prompt**
   - Same addition as above

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes  
**Token cost:** ~400 tokens total across 4 prompts

---

### 🔧 Phase 3: Verification Script Integration (OPTIONAL)

**What to do:**

1. **Test script on Sobotkova extraction:**
   ```bash
   python /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/scripts/verify_quotes.py \
       sobotkova_extraction_rdmap_pass2_COMPLETE.json \
       sobotkova-et-al-2023-gemini.md
   ```

2. **Review script output:**
   - Check detection accuracy
   - Verify fix suggestions are helpful
   - Adjust detection thresholds if needed

3. **Integrate into workflow:**
   - Add script call after Pass 1 extraction
   - Use output to guide Pass 2 fixes
   - Document in workflow guide

**Estimated time:** 30-60 minutes for testing and integration  
**When to use:** If pass rate still <95% after Phase 2

---

## Expected Outcomes by Phase

### Baseline (Current - Sobotkova)
```
Evidence/Claims:  66.3% pass rate (32 failures)
RDMAP:            20.5% pass rate (31 failures)
Overall:          52.8% pass rate (67 failures)
Status:           FAIL - blocks assessment
```

### After Phase 1 Only (Skill Updates)
```
Expected pass rate: 75-80%
Improvement:        +20-25% (detailed guidance helps)
Limitation:         Not enforced, relies on Claude reading
Status:             Still likely FAIL
```

### After Phase 2 (Skill + Prompt Reminders)
```
Expected pass rate: 85-90%
Improvement:        +35-40% (explicit reminders catch most)
Limitation:         Some edge cases may slip through
Status:             PASS WITH ISSUES (acceptable)
```

### After Phase 3 (+ Verification Script)
```
Expected pass rate: 95-98%
Improvement:        +45-50% (automated detection of problems)
Limitation:         Very rare edge cases only
Status:             PASS - assessment-ready
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Minimal Intervention (After Phase 1)

**Method:** Run extraction with only skill updates, no prompt changes

**Purpose:** Establish baseline improvement from guidance alone

**Success criteria:** >75% pass rate

---

### Test 2: Full LLM Approach (After Phase 2)

**Method:** Run extraction with skill + prompt reminders

**Purpose:** Measure effectiveness of LLM-enforced verbatim requirements

**Success criteria:** >90% pass rate

---

### Test 3: Hybrid Approach (After Phase 3)

**Method:** Run extraction with skill + prompts + verification script

**Purpose:** Validate that automation catches what LLM misses

**Success criteria:** >95% pass rate

---

## Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Decided: Skill-Heavy, Prompt-Light

**Rationale:**
- Prompts already long (token cost)
- Skill has slack (unused capacity)
- On-demand loading (not always in context)
- Easier to maintain (one source of truth)

**Alternative considered:** Detailed instructions in prompts  
**Why rejected:** Token bloat, harder to maintain

---

### ✅ Decided: Progressive Disclosure

**Rationale:**
- Brief reminder in prompt → Most cases
- Read detailed guide if uncertain → Edge cases
- Verification script → Final safety net

**Alternative considered:** Force reading guide every time  
**Why rejected:** Token waste for simple cases

---

### ✅ Decided: Minimal Schema Changes

**Rationale:**
- Schema is structural, not procedural
- Quote format validation can't catch paraphrasing
- Skill is better place for procedural guidance

**Alternative considered:** Schema-enforced quote format  
**Why rejected:** Can't validate content quality programmatically

---

### ✅ Decided: Optional Verification Script

**Rationale:**
- Many failures may be caught by prompts alone
- Script adds complexity to workflow
- Start minimal, add if needed

**Alternative considered:** Mandatory script in workflow  
**Why rejected:** Over-engineering for problem that may be solved with prompts

---

## Maintenance Plan

### When to Update

**Verbatim requirements file:**
- New failure patterns emerge in validation
- Domain-specific requirements identified
- User feedback suggests unclear guidance

**Prompts:**
- Only if pass rate doesn't reach 90%
- Rephrase if reminders ignored
- Add emphasis if rules not followed

**Verification script:**
- Adjust detection thresholds based on false positives/negatives
- Add new pattern detection as needed
- Improve fix suggestions based on user feedback

---

### Who Maintains What

**Skill files** (`references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`):
- You (skill owner)
- Updated based on pattern analysis across papers
- Version controlled with skill

**Prompts** (extraction prompts):
- You (prompt owner)
- Updated minimally, only when needed
- Tested on multiple papers before changes

**Scripts** (`scripts/verify_quotes.py`):
- You or technical collaborator
- Enhanced with new detection patterns
- Kept backward-compatible
