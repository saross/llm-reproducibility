# Verification Procedures Update - RDMAP Section Added

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** Phase 1, Task 1.2 - Add RDMAP verification section  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Missing

**Critical Problem:** Pass 3 prompt instructs validators to read verification-procedures.md for RDMAP verification procedures, but the file contained NO RDMAP section.

**Impact:** 
- Pass 3 validation of RDMAP objects impossible without procedures
- Validators had no guidance on explicit vs implicit RDMAP verification
- No worked examples for RDMAP verification passes/fails
- RDMAP quality could not be assessed systematically

---

## What Was Added

### New PART 3: Verification for RDMAP Objects

**Location:** Inserted after Part 2 (Implicit Arguments), before old Part 3 (now Part 4)  
**Length:** ~450 lines covering complete RDMAP verification

**Content includes:**

#### 1. RDMAP Status Distinction (Explicit vs Implicit)
- Clear explanation of when RDMAP is explicit (documented in Methods)
- Clear explanation of when RDMAP is implicit (not in Methods)
- Guidance on checking status field first

#### 2. Explicit RDMAP Verification (3-step procedure)
**Step 1: Location Verification**
- Must be in Methods section (or subsections)
- Decision tree for location verification
- Common failures explained

**Step 2: Quote Verification**  
- Verbatim quote must be found in Methods
- Methods descriptions may span multiple sentences
- Technical terminology must match

**Step 3: Content-Quote Alignment**
- RDMAP description must match quote
- Red flags: adding specificity, naming equipment not mentioned, claiming standardization
- Examples of proper alignment vs overinterpretation

#### 3. Implicit RDMAP Verification (3-step procedure)
**Step 1: Trigger Location Verification**
- All trigger locations must exist
- May be in Results, Discussion, Introduction (not Methods)
- Each location must relate to RDMAP item

**Step 2: Trigger Quote Verification**
- Each trigger passage must be found verbatim
- Triggers should IMPLY procedure, not STATE it
- Multiple triggers often needed

**Step 3: Inference Reasonableness**
- Two basis types explained: mentioned_undocumented vs inferred_from_results
- Conservative inference required
- Reconstruction confidence must match evidence strength
- Check if actually explicit (should be reclassified)

#### 4. RDMAP-Specific Red Flags
**For Explicit RDMAP:**
- Quote in Results/Discussion instead of Methods
- Adding equipment models not in quote
- Claiming standardization not stated
- Adding precision values not documented

**For Implicit RDMAP:**
- Actually stated in Methods (should be explicit)
- Inferring specific procedures from vague mentions
- High reconstruction confidence with weak triggers
- Inventing calibration/validation procedures

#### 5. Implicit Metadata Requirements
- Complete explanation of all four required fields
- basis: mentioned_undocumented vs inferred_from_results
- transparency_gap: what's missing from Methods
- assessability_impact: how gap affects assessment
- reconstruction_confidence: high/medium/low with criteria

#### 6. Worked Examples (4 complete examples)
**Example 1: Explicit Method - PASS ✓**
- Complete extraction with verification
- All three checks pass
- Shows proper Methods documentation

**Example 2: Explicit Protocol - FAIL (Added Details)**
- Protocol adds specificity not in quote
- Demonstrates content_aligned failure
- Action: reclassify as implicit or delete

**Example 3: Implicit Protocol - PASS ✓**
- Properly inferred from triggers
- Complete implicit_metadata
- Appropriate reconstruction confidence

**Example 4: Implicit Method - FAIL (Weak Inference)**
- Speculative leap from weak trigger
- Inappropriate reconstruction confidence
- Action: DELETE

## Document Restructuring

### Part Numbers Updated
- **Old PART 3:** Worked Examples → **New PART 4:** Worked Examples
- **Old PART 4:** Red Flags → **New PART 5:** Red Flags
- **Old PART 5:** Edge Cases → **New PART 6:** Edge Cases
- **Old PART 6:** Quality Metrics → **New PART 7:** Quality Metrics
- **Old PART 7:** Failure Handling → **New PART 8:** Failure Handling
- **Old PART 8:** Workflow Summary → **New PART 9:** Workflow Summary

All internal references to part numbers remain consistent (none exist in this document).

---

## Part 9 Additions (Workflow Summary)

Added two new verification checklists:

### For EACH explicit RDMAP item:
□ Step 1: Navigate to Methods location
□ Step 2: Search for verbatim_quote
□ Step 3: Compare RDMAP text to quote
□ Step 4-6: Notes, verified_by, failure handling

### For EACH implicit RDMAP item:
□ Step 1: Verify all trigger locations
□ Step 2: Verify all trigger quotes
□ Step 3: Evaluate inference (includes metadata check)
□ Step 4-6: Notes, verified_by, failure handling

### Critical Reminders Updated
Added two RDMAP-specific reminders:
- 11. **RDMAP status matters** - Check status field first
- 12. **Implicit RDMAP needs full metadata** - All four fields required

---

## Integration Points

### With Pass 1 RDMAP Prompt
- Pass 1 instructs extractors to mark status (explicit/implicit)
- Pass 1 requires verbatim_quote for explicit OR trigger_text for implicit
- Verification procedures now validate these requirements

### With Pass 3 Validation Prompt
- Pass 3 references verification-procedures.md at line 218
- Pass 3 instructs validators to follow these procedures for RDMAP
- Now has complete procedures to reference

### With Schema v2.5
- Schema has status fields (design_status, method_status, protocol_status)
- Schema has implicit field infrastructure
- Schema has source_verification object for RDMAP
- Verification procedures now align with schema structure

---

## Coverage Completeness

### What's Now Covered ✅
- Explicit RDMAP verification (all 3 steps)
- Implicit RDMAP verification (all 3 steps)
- RDMAP-specific red flags
- Implicit metadata requirements
- Worked examples (passes and fails)
- Integration with workflow summary

### What's NOT Covered (By Design)
- Quality metrics specific to RDMAP (uses same metrics as Evidence/Claims)
- Failure handling specific to RDMAP (uses same decision tree)
- Edge cases specific to RDMAP (covered in existing edge cases section)

This is appropriate - RDMAP verification follows same patterns as Evidence/Claims and Implicit Arguments, just applied to methodological content.

## Files Updated

**Location:** `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/verification-procedures.md`  
**Backup:** `/mnt/user-data/outputs/verification-procedures_with_RDMAP.md`

**The skill file is now ready for use with Pass 3 RDMAP validation.**

---

**Critical gap now closed:** Pass 3 validators can now properly verify RDMAP objects using comprehensive, systematic procedures.
