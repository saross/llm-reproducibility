# Completion Summary - Skill Repackaging & Prompt Streamlining

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** Repackage research-assessor skill and streamline RDMAP Pass 3 prompt

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Streamlined RDMAP Pass 3 Prompt ✅

**File:** `rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md`

**Changes made:**
- Reduced from 630 lines to ~570 lines (~10% reduction)
- Removed excessive implementation detail
- Referenced verification-procedures.md for detailed guidance (following Pass 2 streamlining pattern)
- **Added RDMAP Source Verification section (Check 4.3)** - this was missing from the attached v2.5 base
- Expanded statistical quality metrics (Check 4.4) to include RDMAP pass rates
- Added status field consistency check (Check 4.5)
- Maintained all critical procedural instructions
- Preserved complete validation report format

**Key streamlining approach:**
- Focus on WHAT to validate and HOW to report
- Reference skill files for detailed procedures
- Remove verbose explanations that duplicate skill content
- Keep decision frameworks and checklists intact

**Pattern followed:** Same streamlining approach used for Pass 2 prompt in previous conversation

---

### 2. Updated Research-Assessor Skill ✅

**File:** `research-assessor.skill`

**Changes made:**

#### Added Files:
1. **`references/extraction-fundamentals.md`** (NEW)
   - Universal sourcing requirements for all extraction passes
   - Explicit vs implicit content distinction
   - Mandatory verbatim_quote and trigger_text requirements
   - Hallucination prevention guidelines
   - Source verification overview
   - Decision tree for extraction decisions

#### Updated Files:
1. **`references/README.md`**
   - Added directory structure entries for new files
   - Added "Core Extraction Principles" section describing extraction-fundamentals.md and verification-procedures.md
   - Updated usage pattern with extraction-fundamentals.md guidance

2. **`SKILL.md`**
   - Added "Core Extraction Principles" subsection in Step 3
   - Listed extraction-fundamentals.md as first reference (ALWAYS read first for Pass 1 & 2)
   - Listed verification-procedures.md for Pass 3 validation

**Existing files preserved:**
- verification-procedures.md (896 lines, comprehensive)
- All schema, checklists, and examples
- Complete reference architecture

---

## Files Available for Download

1. **rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md** - Streamlined Pass 3 validation prompt with RDMAP source verification
2. **research-assessor.skill** - Updated skill package with extraction-fundamentals.md included

Both files located in: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`

---

## Key Improvements

### Prompt Streamlining Benefits:
- **Reduced token cost** - ~10% reduction while maintaining all critical content
- **Improved maintainability** - References skill files for details rather than duplicating
- **Consistent architecture** - Follows same pattern as Pass 2 streamlining
- **Complete functionality** - Added missing RDMAP verification that was in bloated version

### Skill Packaging Benefits:
- **Universal sourcing discipline** - extraction-fundamentals.md provides consistent sourcing requirements across all passes
- **Hallucination prevention** - Clear guidance on when content is explicit vs implicit, required sourcing fields
- **Better discoverability** - Updated README and SKILL.md make new references easy to find
- **Progressive disclosure** - Extraction-fundamentals.md loaded only when needed (Pass 1 & 2)

---

## Usage Notes

### For RDMAP Pass 3 Validation:
Use the streamlined prompt (`rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md`) which now includes:
- Complete RDMAP source verification (Check 4.3)
- Expanded statistical metrics for RDMAP (Check 4.4)
- Status field consistency checks (Check 4.5)
- All other validation checks from original

The prompt references `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/verification-procedures.md` for detailed verification procedures.

### For Extraction (Pass 1 & 2):
Extraction prompts should reference `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/extraction-fundamentals.md` at the start to ensure:
- Proper explicit vs implicit classification
- Complete sourcing fields (verbatim_quote or trigger_text/trigger_locations)
- Hallucination prevention discipline

---

## Next Steps

1. **Download both files** from outputs directory
2. **Test the streamlined Pass 3 prompt** on existing extraction
3. **Update Pass 1 & Pass 2 prompts** (both Claims/Evidence and RDMAP) to reference extraction-fundamentals.md at the beginning
4. **Deploy updated skill** to replace current research-assessor skill
