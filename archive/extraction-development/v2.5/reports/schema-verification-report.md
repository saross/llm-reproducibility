# Schema Verification Report - Research Assessor Skill

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Checked:** Research assessor skill schema against uploaded extraction_schema.json

---

## Summary: ✅ VERIFIED - Schema is Correct

The research-assessor skill is using **schema v2.4** which matches your uploaded current version.

---

## Verification Details

### 1. Schema Version ✅

**In skill (schema-guide.md):**
```json
"schema_version": "2.4"
```

**In uploaded schema (extraction_schema.json):**
```json
"title": "Academic Research Extraction Schema v2.4",
"version": "2.4",
"last_updated": "2025-10-19"
```

**Status:** ✅ Matches - Both are v2.4 from 2025-10-19

---

### 2. Core Structure ✅

**Both include all six object types:**
- `evidence` ✅
- `claims` ✅
- `implicit_arguments` ✅
- `research_designs` ✅ (NEW in v2.4)
- `methods` ✅ (NEW in v2.4)
- `protocols` ✅ (NEW in v2.4)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All v2.4 RDMAP objects present

---

### 3. Key v2.4 Features ✅

**Checked for v2.4 additions:**

1. **RDMAP three-tier hierarchy** ✅
   - research_designs (strategic WHY)
   - methods (tactical WHAT)
   - protocols (operational HOW)

2. **Consolidation metadata** ✅
   - Present in schema-guide.md
   - Part of v2.3 carryover, maintained in v2.4

3. **Cross-references to RDMAP** ✅
   - validates_methods array
   - validates_protocols array
   - implements_methods array
   - implements_designs array

4. **Methodological arguments** ✅
   - claim_type includes "methodological_argument"
   - implicit_argument includes Type 4 & 5 (design/methodological assumptions)

**Status:** ✅ All v2.4 features present

---

### 4. File Organization

**Current skill structure:**
```
research-assessor/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── schema/
        └── schema-guide.md (only schema file)
```

**What's present:**
- ✅ schema-guide.md (v2.4) - Human-readable documentation
- ❌ extraction_schema.json - NOT present (but not required)

**Analysis:**
The skill currently has only the **schema-guide.md** (human-readable docs), not the actual JSON schema file. This is acceptable because:

1. **Skills use progressive disclosure** - The guide is what Claude needs during extraction
2. **JSON schema is for validation** - Not needed during extraction execution
3. **Prompts reference the guide** - All cross-references point to schema-guide.md

**However**, you may want to add the JSON schema file for:
- **Completeness** - Having the authoritative schema definition
- **Validation** - If you later want to validate extractions programmatically
- **Reference** - Having the complete specification available

---

### 5. Schema Guide Accuracy ✅

**Spot-checked key definitions against uploaded schema:**

**Evidence object:**
- Required fields match: evidence_id, evidence_text, evidence_type ✅
- Key fields present: supports_claims, related_evidence, consolidation_metadata ✅
- v2.4 additions noted: validates_methods, validates_protocols ✅

**Claim object:**
- Required fields match: claim_id, claim_text, claim_type, claim_role ✅
- v2.4 addition: "methodological_argument" in claim_type enum ✅

**RDMAP objects:**
- All three types documented: research_designs, methods, protocols ✅
- Three-tier hierarchy explained correctly ✅

**Status:** ✅ Schema guide accurately reflects uploaded JSON schema

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Keep As-Is (Minimal) ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Current state is functional:**
- Schema guide (v2.4) is accurate
- All prompts reference schema-guide.md correctly
- Progressive disclosure working as intended

**Action:** None required - skill is using correct schema

---

### Option B: Add JSON Schema File (Complete)

**If you want the full schema in the skill:**

1. Copy extraction_schema.json to skill:
   ```
   research-assessor/references/schema/extraction_schema.json
   ```

2. Update schema-guide.md introduction to reference it:
   ```markdown
   **Complete JSON schema:** See `extraction_schema.json` for programmatic validation
   ```

3. Re-package and reinstall skill

**Benefits:**
- Complete schema specification available
- Enables programmatic validation if needed later
- Single source of truth present

**Downside:**
- Larger skill package (~1.5KB more)
- Not strictly necessary for extraction tasks

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Schema is correct** - The research-assessor skill uses schema v2.4 which matches your current uploaded version.

✅ **No action required** - The schema-guide.md accurately documents all v2.4 features and is the appropriate reference for extraction tasks.

⚠️ **Optional enhancement** - You may choose to add the full JSON schema file (extraction_schema.json) to the skill for completeness, but it's not necessary for functionality.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Schema verified - No concerns
2. ⏭️ Ready to proceed with prompt revisions for the other 4 prompts
3. ⏭️ (Optional) Add extraction_schema.json to skill if desired

Would you like me to:
- **A.** Proceed with revising the other 4 prompts (you'll provide them)
- **B.** First add the JSON schema file to the skill for completeness
- **C.** Both (add schema, then revise prompts)
