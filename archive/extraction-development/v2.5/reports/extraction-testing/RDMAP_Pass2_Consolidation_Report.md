## Executive Summary

Successfully completed RDMAP Pass 2 consolidation, achieving **18.8% reduction** in total items (48 → 39) through 8 strategic consolidations. All consolidations maintain complete information with proper sourcing discipline (verbatim_quote for explicit items, trigger_text for implicit items). No tier corrections or boundary corrections were needed - Pass 1 classifications were accurate.

**Result:** 48 RDMAP items → 39 RDMAP items (reduction: 9 items, 18.8%)

## Consolidation Summary by Tier

### Research Designs: 10 → 8 items (20% reduction)

**Consolidation 1: RD003 + RD004 → RD003 (TRAP Project Aims)**

## Ready for Pass 3 Validation

Pass 2 rationalization is complete and the extraction is ready for Pass 3 validation, which will:

1. Verify all sourcing claims (verbatim_quote locations, trigger_text accuracy)
2. Check structural integrity (cross-references, field completeness)
3. Assess consistency (reasoning approaches, timing inferences)
4. Flag any remaining quality issues

**Expected Pass 3 verification rate:** >95% (high confidence given Pass 2 quality checks)

## Notes

- **Zero tier corrections needed:** Pass 1 classifications (Design/Method/Protocol) were accurate
- **Zero boundary corrections needed:** RDMAP vs claims boundary was accurate in Pass 1
- **Information preservation:** All 8 consolidations marked "complete" - no information loss
