# Schema Corrections - extraction_schema_v2.5.json

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Fix critical schema issues  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Field Name Correction ✅

**Changed:** `source_items` → `consolidated_from` in consolidation_metadata definition

**Location:** Line 59  
**Why:** Prompts consistently use `consolidated_from` (more descriptive). Schema must match.

```json
"consolidated_from": {
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "description": "Pass 1 item IDs that were merged to create this item"
}
```

---

### 2. Added Status Fields to RDMAP Objects ✅

**Added to:** research_design_object, method_object, protocol_object

**Fields added:**
- `design_status` (research_design_object)
- `method_status` (method_object)
- `protocol_status` (protocol_object)

**Structure:**
```json
"[object_type]_status": {
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["explicit", "implicit"],
  "description": "Whether documented in Methods (explicit) or inferred (implicit)"
}
```

**Why:** Prompts reference these fields extensively for explicit/implicit distinction. Without these fields, extractions fail schema validation.

---

### 3. Added Implicit Field Infrastructure to RDMAP Objects ✅

**Added to:** research_design_object, method_object, protocol_object

**Fields added (all nullable for explicit items):**

#### trigger_text
```json
"trigger_text": {
  "type": ["array", "null"],
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "description": "Verbatim passages implying this [object] (for implicit items)"
}
```

#### trigger_locations
```json
"trigger_locations": {
  "type": ["array", "null"],
  "items": {
    "$ref": "#/definitions/location"
  },
  "description": "Locations of trigger passages (parallel to trigger_text array)"
}
```

#### inference_reasoning
```json
"inference_reasoning": {
  "type": ["string", "null"],
  "description": "Explanation of how triggers support inference (for implicit items)"
}
```

#### implicit_metadata
```json
"implicit_metadata": {
  "type": ["object", "null"],
  "description": "Additional metadata for implicit [objects]",
  "properties": {
    "basis": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["mentioned_undocumented", "inferred_from_results"],
      "description": "How implicit item was inferred"
    },
    "transparency_gap": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "What information is missing from Methods section"
    },
    "assessability_impact": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "How lack of documentation affects credibility assessment"
    },
    "reconstruction_confidence": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["high", "medium", "low"],
      "description": "Confidence in reconstruction of actual [object]"
    }
  },
  "required": ["basis", "transparency_gap", "assessability_impact", "reconstruction_confidence"]
}
```

**Why:** RDMAP Pass 1 prompt instructs extractors to populate these fields for implicit items. Without these fields in schema, implicit RDMAP extractions impossible.

---

### 4. Added source_verification to RDMAP Objects ✅

**Added to:** research_design_object, method_object, protocol_object

**Structure:**
```json
"source_verification": {
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Verification that content is properly sourced - populated in Pass 3",
  "properties": {
    "location_verified": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Confirmed: stated location exists and discusses [object]"
    },
    "quote_verified": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "For explicit: verbatim_quote found. For implicit: trigger_text found"
    },
    "content_aligned": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "For explicit: [object] matches quote. For implicit: inference reasonable"
    },
    "verification_notes": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Details of verification or reasons for failure"
    },
    "verified_by": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["extractor", "validator", "manual_review"],
      "description": "Who performed verification"
    }
  },
  "required": ["location_verified", "quote_verified", "content_aligned"]
}
```

**Why:** Pass 3 validation prompt requires source_verification for ALL object types including RDMAP. Prevents hallucination and enables automated validation.

## Validation Results

### JSON Syntax ✅
- Schema is well-formed JSON
- All brackets and braces balanced
- No syntax errors

### Schema Completeness ✅
- All three RDMAP objects have status fields
- All three RDMAP objects have trigger infrastructure
- All three RDMAP objects have implicit_metadata
- All three RDMAP objects have source_verification
- Field name `consolidated_from` used consistently

### Cross-References ✅
- `$ref` to `#/definitions/location` works for trigger_locations
- `$ref` to `#/definitions/consolidation_metadata` works for all objects

---

## Impact on Prompts

### RDMAP Pass 1 Prompt
**Now works:** Can extract both explicit and implicit RDMAP items with proper status and sourcing

**Fields now extractable:**
- `design_status`, `method_status`, `protocol_status`
- `trigger_text`, `trigger_locations`, `inference_reasoning`
- `implicit_metadata` (all subfields)

### RDMAP Pass 3 Prompt
**Now works:** Can validate RDMAP source integrity

**Validation now possible:**
- Location verification for RDMAP
- Quote/trigger verification for RDMAP
- Content alignment checks for RDMAP
- Verification metrics tracking for RDMAP

### All Prompts Using Consolidation
**Now works:** Field name `consolidated_from` matches schema

**Fixed inconsistency:** No more mismatch between prompts and schema

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before full deployment:

1. **Schema validation test:**
   - Load schema into JSON validator
   - Verify all object definitions complete
   - Check all $ref references resolve

2. **End-to-end extraction test:**
   - Run Pass 1 RDMAP extraction
   - Verify status fields populate correctly
   - Verify implicit RDMAP items extract with full metadata
   - Check consolidation_metadata uses `consolidated_from`

3. **Pass 3 validation test:**
   - Run Pass 3 on RDMAP extraction
   - Verify source_verification populates for all RDMAP objects
   - Check verification metrics calculate correctly

---

## Files Updated

**Input:** `extraction_schema.json` (original, uploaded)  
**Output:** `extraction_schema_v2.5_corrected.json` (corrected, in /outputs)

**Changes:**
- Line 59: Field name change
- After line 1167: Added 6 fields to research_design_object
- After line 1532: Added 6 fields to method_object
- After line 1889: Added 6 fields to protocol_object

**Total additions:** 19 new fields (1 rename + 18 additions)

---

## Next Steps

**Completed:**
- ✅ Task 1.1: Fix extraction_schema.json

**Up next:**
- Task 1.2: Add RDMAP section to verification-procedures.md
- Task 1.3: Update schema-guide.md to v2.5
- Task 1.4: Standardize skill references in all prompts

---

**Schema now ready for use with corrected prompts.**
