# Error Source Investigation - COMPLETE

**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ✓ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED

---

## Investigation Results

### ✓ Schema (extraction_schema.json) - CLEAN
- JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
- Uses correct field names throughout
- `implements_designs` ✓
- `realized_through_protocols` ✓

### ✓ Skill (research-assessor) - CLEAN
- Documentation uses correct field names
- Examples show correct field names
- No incorrect field names found

### ✗ RDMAP Pass 1 Prompt - ERROR SOURCE IDENTIFIED

**File:** `rdmap_pass1_prompt.md`

**4 errors found:**
1. Line 44: Uses `uses_protocols` (should be `realized_through_protocols`)
2. Line 244: Uses `design_context` (should be `implements_designs`)
3. Line 245: Uses `uses_protocols` (should be `realized_through_protocols`)  
4. Line 280: Uses `design_context` (should be `implements_designs`)

---

## Root Cause

The RDMAP Pass 1 prompt explicitly instructed Claude to use incorrect field names:

**Line 244:**
```markdown
❌ Research Designs `enables_methods` → Methods `design_context`
✓  Research Designs `enables_methods` → Methods `implements_designs`
```

**Line 245:**
```markdown
❌ Methods `uses_protocols` → Protocols `implements_method`
✓  Methods `realized_through_protocols` → Protocols `implements_method`
```

Claude followed these instructions precisely, using `design_context` and `uses_protocols` in all 7 Methods.

## Impact

**Original Extraction:**
- ✗ 26 critical validation failures
- ✗ FAIL status

**After Correction:**
- ✓ 0 critical issues
- ✓ PASS status

**Data Quality:**
- ✓ All cross-reference data correct
- ✓ Only field names were wrong
- ✓ Simple field rename resolved everything

---

## Actions Completed

1. ✓ **Error source identified** - RDMAP Pass 1 prompt lines 44, 244, 245, 280
2. ✓ **Extraction corrected** - Field names updated in sobotkova_rdmap_pass2_corrected.json
3. ✓ **Re-validation completed** - PASS status achieved
4. ✓ **Prompt corrected** - rdmap_pass1_prompt_corrected.md created
5. ✓ **Documentation updated** - error_source_analysis.md completed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action
✓ Use the corrected extraction for assessment phase

### For Future Extractions
1. **Use corrected Pass 1 prompt** - rdmap_pass1_prompt_corrected.md
2. **Check Pass 2 prompt** - Likely has same errors, should be reviewed
3. **Update your prompt library** - Replace old version with corrected version

### Prevention
- ✓ Corrected prompts ready
- Consider: Validate prompts against schema before use
- Consider: Add field name check to Pass 1 or Pass 2

---

## Pass 2 Prompt Analysis

**Recommended:** Check your RDMAP Pass 2 prompt for same errors.

**What to look for:**
- References to `design_context` (should be `implements_designs`)
- References to `uses_protocols` (should be `realized_through_protocols`)

If found, apply same corrections as Pass 1.

---

## Summary

**The Good:**
- ✓ Schema is correct
- ✓ Skill is correct  
- ✓ Extraction quality is high
- ✓ Only prompt needed fixing
- ✓ All corrections completed

**The Lesson:**
Runtime prompts have highest authority during extraction. Even with correct schema and skill documentation, incorrect prompt instructions will be followed precisely.

**The Solution:**
Use the corrected prompts and maintain prompt/schema version synchronization.

## Questions?

**Q: Should I re-extract from scratch?**  
A: No - the corrected extraction is already validated and ready to use.

**Q: Will this affect assessment?**  
A: No - the corrected extraction has proper field names and PASS status.

**Q: What about Pass 2 prompt?**  
A: Likely has same errors - recommend checking it next (optional but good practice).

**Q: How prevent this in future?**  
A: Use the corrected prompts and verify field names match schema v2.4 before extraction.
