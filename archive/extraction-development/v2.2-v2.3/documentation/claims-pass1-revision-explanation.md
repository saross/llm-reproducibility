# Claims/Evidence Pass 1 v2.4 - Revision Explanation

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Original:** ~810 lines  
**Revised:** ~680 lines  
**Reduction:** 16% (~130 lines removed)

---

## Revision Philosophy

**Conservative approach applied:**
- Prompts already performing well → minimize risk
- Remove only clear redundancy with SKILL.md
- Keep most examples (~12 retained) 
- Tighten rather than cut
- Preserve all functional guidance

**Skill-optimization applied:**
- Add cross-references to skill components
- Position checklist early for immediate roadmap
- Streamline structural content (workflow, philosophy)
- Show essential fields only (not complete schema)

---

## Major Structural Changes

### 1. Quality Checklist Repositioned ✓

**Before:** At end of prompt (lines 785-800)  
**After:** Near top, immediately after "Your Task" (lines 20-50)

**Rationale:**
- Claude needs success criteria BEFORE diving into details
- Checklist serves as roadmap for extraction
- Early positioning in skill context = immediate orientation
- Still after "Your Task" so Claude knows what it's doing first

**Impact:** Better execution quality - Claude knows what "done" looks like upfront

---

### 2. Workflow Description Streamlined ✓

**Before:** 
- Lines 15-20: Extended explanation of iterative workflow
- Lines 22-49: Extended "Extraction Philosophy" 
- Total: ~55 lines

**After:**
- Lines 1-18: Condensed to essentials
- Removed: Detailed workflow explanation (in SKILL.md)
- Removed: Extended philosophy justification (in SKILL.md)
- Total: ~18 lines

**Retained:**
- Core message: "Over-extract rather than under-extract"
- Input/output specification
- Array responsibilities (which arrays to touch/leave)
- Pass 1 principle statement

**Rationale:**
- SKILL.md already explains iterative workflow thoroughly
- SKILL.md already explains liberal-then-rationalize philosophy
- Prompt just needs brief reminder, not re-explanation

**Impact:** -37 lines, no loss of functional guidance

---

### 3. Evidence vs Claims Distinction Condensed ✓

**Before:** Lines 51-80 (~30 lines) - Extended discussion with multiple examples

**After:** Lines 52-72 (~20 lines) - Focused essential distinction

**Changes:**
- Kept: Core definitions, key tests
- Kept: Professional judgment boundary (critical decision point)
- Added: Cross-reference to tier-assignment-guide.md
- Removed: Redundant examples (kept 1 example each for evidence/claims)
- Removed: Extended justification of distinction

**Rationale:**
- SKILL.md covers this at high level
- tier-assignment-guide.md has detailed decision framework
- Prompt needs just enough to execute, not teach the concept
- Professional judgment boundary is CRITICAL - kept prominent

**Impact:** -10 lines, maintained decision quality

---

### 4. Object Templates Simplified ✓

**Before:** Full schema structure (~100+ lines showing all fields)

**After:** Essential Pass 1 fields only (~60 lines)

**Changes:**
- Kept: All fields actually used in Pass 1
- Removed: Fields primarily used in Pass 2 (consolidation_metadata, etc.)
- Removed: Optional fields rarely populated
- Added: Cross-reference to schema-guide.md for complete structure

**Rationale:**
- Pass 1 doesn't need every possible field
- Showing only essential fields reduces cognitive load
- Complete schema available in references/schema/schema-guide.md
- This is progressive disclosure in action

**Impact:** -40 lines, clearer essential structure

---

### 5. "Remember" Postamble Removed ✓

**Before:** Lines 785-800 (~15 lines) - Summary postamble

**After:** Final line is concise "Pass 1 Goal" statement

**Rationale:**
- Redundant summary of what's already in the prompt
- If prompt requires summary, prompt is too long/unclear
- Better to make the prompt itself clear throughout

**Impact:** -15 lines, no functional loss

---

### 6. Cross-References Added ✓

**New additions throughout:**

```markdown
Line 31: "*(Uncertain? See references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md)*"

Line 72: "*For detailed decision framework, see references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md*"

Line 173: "*For detailed classification guidance, see references/checklists/expected-information.md*"

Line 254: "*For comprehensive checklists by domain, see references/checklists/expected-information.md*"

Line 329, 366, 396: "*For complete schema, see references/schema/schema-guide.md*"

Line 670: "*For Pass 2 rationalization guidance, see references/workflow/claims-pass2.md*"
```

**Rationale:**
- Makes skill architecture visible
- Guides Claude to additional resources when uncertain
- Leverages progressive disclosure principle
- Reduces need to duplicate content across files

**Impact:** Better resource utilization, clearer skill architecture

---

## What Was Preserved (Conservative Approach)

### Examples Retained (~12 examples) ✓

**Kept all examples that:**
1. Resolve genuine ambiguity
2. Show non-obvious patterns
3. Prevent common errors
4. Illustrate complex decisions

**Examples retained:**
- Evidence Type 1-5 (each with example)
- Extraction Pattern 1-6 (critical patterns)
- Claim types with examples
- Implicit argument types (4 types, each with example)

**Examples tightened:**
- Some verbose explanations condensed
- Retained core pattern and decision logic
- Ensured 3-line format where possible

**Impact:** Strong pattern library maintained, slight compression

---

### Decision Frameworks Maintained ✓

**No changes to:**
- Evidence types classification
- Claim types and functions
- Implicit argument taxonomy
- Expected information checklists
- Common pitfalls list

**Rationale:**
- These are functional guidance, not structural content
- Already performing well in testing
- Conservative approach = preserve what works

---

### Extraction Workflow Unchanged ✓

**Step-by-step extraction process preserved:**
- Initial scan → Section extraction → Build hierarchy → Quality check
- All sub-steps maintained
- Decision logic intact

**Rationale:**
- This is the actionable core of the prompt
- Process has been tested and validated
- No redundancy with SKILL.md here

---

## Sections Reorganized for Better Flow

### New Structure:

```
1. Your Task (what, input, output)
2. Quality Checklist (success criteria - NEW POSITION)
3. Core Distinctions (evidence vs claims, hierarchy)
4. Evidence Types (5 types, examples)
5. Claim Types and Functions (classification)
6. Implicit Arguments (4 types, examples)
7. Extraction Workflow (step-by-step process)
8. Expected Information Checklists (by claim type)
9. Common Extraction Patterns (6 patterns)
10. Object Structure (essential fields)
11. Common Pitfalls (9 pitfalls)
12. Output Format
13. Next Steps
```

**Rationale:**
- Checklist near top = immediate orientation
- Core distinctions before types = foundation first
- Workflow in middle = detailed execution guidance
- Object structure late = reference material
- Logical progression from "what to do" → "how to do it" → "reference"

## What Makes This "Skill-Optimized"

**Before (Standalone Prompt):**
- Self-contained, assumes no prior context
- Explains everything from first principles
- Includes complete schema specifications
- Standalone philosophy justification

**After (Skill-Embedded Prompt):**
- Assumes SKILL.md provides context
- Focuses on execution, not explanation
- References schema guide for details
- Brief philosophy reminder only

**The shift:** From "teach and execute" to "execute with support available"

---

## Testing Recommendations

**Before using revised prompt:**

1. **Test on known section** (e.g., Sobotkova Methods)
   - Compare Pass 1 output quality to original prompt
   - Check: Are all items still captured?
   - Check: Are classifications still accurate?

2. **Verify cross-references work**
   - When Claude encounters uncertainty, does it reference checklists?
   - Do references resolve ambiguity effectively?

3. **Check checklist positioning**
   - Does early checklist improve extraction quality?
   - Does it reduce items that shouldn't be extracted?

4. **Monitor token usage**
   - 16% reduction should show in skill invocation metrics
   - Faster load time with same quality

**If issues emerge:**
- Specific examples can be expanded
- Cross-references can be made more prominent
- Checklist can be repositioned if needed
- Easy to iterate on individual sections

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Changes:**
- Removed redundancy with SKILL.md (philosophy, workflow)
- Repositioned checklist
- Simplified object templates
- Removed "Remember" postamble
- Added cross-references

**Medium Risk Changes:**
- Condensed evidence vs claims distinction (-10 lines)
- Tightened examples (-25 lines across multiple sections)

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative approach to examples (kept ~12)
- Professional judgment boundary preserved (critical)
- All decision frameworks maintained
- Cross-references added for uncertain cases

**Testing will reveal:**
- Whether condensed guidance maintains quality
- Whether cross-references are sufficient
- Whether examples could be further tightened (or need expansion)

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Review this revision approach
2. Test revised prompt on known section
3. Assess quality vs original prompt
4. Decide: proceed to other 4 prompts? or iterate?

**If successful:**
1. Apply similar approach to Claims Pass 2
2. Apply to RDMAP Pass 1, 2, 3
3. Test complete workflow with revised prompts

**If issues emerge:**
1. Identify specific problem areas
2. Expand examples or add detail as needed
3. Adjust cross-reference strategy
4. Iterate on individual sections

## Lessons for Other Prompt Revisions

**Principles applied here:**
1. **Remove redundancy** - What's in SKILL.md doesn't need repetition
2. **Add cross-references** - Point to resources explicitly
3. **Essential over complete** - Show what's needed now, reference rest
4. **Position strategically** - Checklist early, reference late
5. **Conservative with risk** - Keep what works, remove only redundancy
6. **Test everything** - Validate that compression maintains quality

**These principles should apply to:**
- Claims Pass 2 revision
- RDMAP Pass 1 revision  
- RDMAP Pass 2 revision
- RDMAP Pass 3 revision

---

**Conclusion:** Revised prompt is 16% shorter while maintaining all functional guidance, optimized for skill context through progressive disclosure and strategic cross-referencing. Conservative approach minimizes risk while demonstrating skill-optimization principles for remaining prompts.
