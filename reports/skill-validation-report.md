# Research Assessor Skill v2.5 - Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Validator:** Claude (using skill-creator guidelines)  
**Status:** ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED - Requires Correction

---

## Executive Summary

The research-assessor skill is **substantially well-formed** with proper structure and content organization. However, it contains **3 violations** of skill-creator packaging standards that must be corrected before deployment.

**Critical Issues:**
1. Extraneous documentation files (PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md, VERSION_HISTORY.md)
2. Erroneous directory artifact (`{schema,checklists,examples}/`)

**Recommendation:** Remove identified files, repackage, and validate again.

## ⚠️ FAILING CRITERIA

### Issue 1: Extraneous Documentation - PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md

**Problem:** Auxiliary documentation file that doesn't support AI agent work

**Skill-Creator Rule Violated:**
> "A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including: README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc."

**Analysis:**
- PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md is a 302-line file documenting the package contents
- Contains metadata about packaging process, file sizes, testing status
- This is user-facing documentation, not AI-agent operational content
- Information is redundant with file structure itself
- Does not improve AI agent's ability to execute tasks

**Required Action:** DELETE this file

---

### Issue 2: Extraneous Documentation - VERSION_HISTORY.md

**Problem:** Changelog-style auxiliary documentation

**Skill-Creator Rule Violated:**
> "Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including: [...] CHANGELOG.md, etc."

**Analysis:**
- VERSION_HISTORY.md is a 195-line changelog
- Documents v2.4 → v2.5 migration and changes
- This is user-facing documentation for human developers
- Not essential for AI agent operation
- Historical information not needed for task execution

**Required Action:** DELETE this file

**Note:** If version information is truly essential for operation, it can be briefly mentioned in SKILL.md frontmatter or first paragraph. However, detailed changelogs have no place in skill packages.

---

### Issue 3: Erroneous Directory Artifact

**Problem:** Literal directory name `{schema,checklists,examples}/` exists

**Analysis:**
- Directory path: `/home/claude/research-assessor-packaged/references/{schema,checklists,examples}`
- This appears to be a shell expansion artifact or tar packaging error
- Should not exist as a literal directory name
- Contains no files (verified empty)

**Required Action:** DELETE this directory

---

## Detailed File Analysis

### Core Files (CORRECT ✅)

**SKILL.md** (232 lines)
- Proper YAML frontmatter with name and description
- Clear usage instructions
- Core decision frameworks included
- Appropriate references to bundled resources
- **Status:** ✅ Correct and well-formed

**references/README.md** (127 lines)
- Navigation-focused (not auxiliary documentation)
- Explains directory structure
- Guides Claude to appropriate files
- **Status:** ✅ Correct - this README serves operational navigation purpose

### Reference Files (CORRECT ✅)

All reference files are properly structured and serve operational purposes:

- ✅ extraction-fundamentals.md - Core extraction principles
- ✅ verification-procedures.md - Validation procedures
- ✅ schema/extraction_schema.json - Operational schema definition
- ✅ schema/schema-guide.md - Human-readable schema documentation
- ✅ checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md - Decision framework
- ✅ checklists/consolidation-patterns.md - Decision framework
- ✅ checklists/expected-information.md - Completeness checklist
- ✅ examples/sobotkova-example.md - Worked example

**Analysis:** All reference files directly support AI agent decision-making and task execution.

## Skill-Creator Compliance Matrix

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SKILL.md with frontmatter | ✅ Pass | Proper YAML format |
| Name and description fields | ✅ Pass | Complete and specific |
| SKILL.md under 500 lines | ✅ Pass | 232 lines |
| References in subdirectory | ✅ Pass | Proper organization |
| Progressive disclosure | ✅ Pass | Well-structured |
| No extraneous docs | ❌ FAIL | PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md, VERSION_HISTORY.md |
| Proper directory structure | ❌ FAIL | Erroneous `{schema,checklists,examples}/` |
| References clearly indicated | ✅ Pass | Well documented in SKILL.md |
| No duplication | ✅ Pass | Good separation |

**Overall Score:** 7/9 criteria passing

---

## Correction Plan

### Step 1: Remove Extraneous Files

```bash
# Remove auxiliary documentation
rm /home/claude/research-assessor-packaged/PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md
rm /home/claude/research-assessor-packaged/VERSION_HISTORY.md

# Remove erroneous directory
rmdir /home/claude/research-assessor-packaged/references/\{schema,checklists,examples\}/
```

### Step 2: Validate Structure

After removal, the skill should contain:
```
research-assessor/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── README.md
    ├── extraction-fundamentals.md
    ├── verification-procedures.md
    ├── schema/
    │   ├── extraction_schema.json
    │   └── schema-guide.md
    ├── checklists/
    │   ├── tier-assignment-guide.md
    │   ├── consolidation-patterns.md
    │   └── expected-information.md
    └── examples/
        └── sobotkova-example.md
```

**Total:** 1 SKILL.md + 11 reference files = 12 files

### Step 3: Repackage

After corrections, repackage using standard tar:
```bash
cd /home/claude
tar -czf research-assessor-v2.5-corrected.tar.gz research-assessor-packaged/
```

## Why These Changes Matter

### Skill-Creator Philosophy

The skill-creator guidelines emphasize:

1. **"The context window is a public good"** - Every file in a skill consumes tokens. Extraneous documentation wastes this shared resource.

2. **"Only add context Claude doesn't already have"** - Packaging metadata and version histories don't help Claude execute tasks.

3. **"Skills are onboarding guides for AI agents"** - Not documentation repositories for human developers.

### Specific Issues with Removed Files

**PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md problems:**
- Describes the package's own structure (redundant - Claude can see files)
- Contains testing metadata irrelevant to operation
- Includes file size information unnecessary for task execution
- Documents installation procedures (users install, not Claude)

**VERSION_HISTORY.md problems:**
- Historical changelog irrelevant to current operation
- Migration guidance is for human developers, not AI agents
- Breaking changes documentation is user-facing, not operational

---

## Post-Correction Quality Metrics

After corrections, the skill will:

**Token Efficiency:**
- ~497 lines removed from package (PACKAGE_MANIFEST + VERSION_HISTORY)
- Estimated 30-40% reduction in package size
- Faster loading, less context bloat

**Compliance:**
- 9/9 skill-creator criteria passing
- Zero extraneous files
- Clean, focused structure

**Operational Quality:**
- All essential operational content preserved
- Progressive disclosure pattern maintained
- Reference organization unchanged

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. ✅ Delete PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md
2. ✅ Delete VERSION_HISTORY.md  
3. ✅ Delete `{schema,checklists,examples}/` directory
4. ✅ Validate corrected structure
5. ✅ Repackage as tar.gz

### Best Practices for Future Packaging
- **Never include:** README (except in references/ for navigation), CHANGELOG, VERSION_HISTORY, PACKAGE_MANIFEST, INSTALLATION_GUIDE, TESTING_NOTES, etc.
- **Only include:** Files that directly support AI agent task execution
- **When in doubt:** Ask "Does Claude need this to complete tasks?"

### If Version Info is Truly Needed
- Add a brief version line in SKILL.md frontmatter: `version: "2.5"`
- Mention breaking changes in first paragraph if critical to operation
- Keep it minimal - one sentence maximum

---

## Conclusion

The research-assessor skill has **excellent core structure** and **high-quality reference materials**. The identified issues are **packaging artifacts** that don't reflect on the underlying work quality.

**Required actions are straightforward:**
1. Delete 3 items (2 files + 1 directory)
2. Repackage
3. Deploy

**After corrections:** The skill will be fully compliant with skill-creator standards and ready for production use.
