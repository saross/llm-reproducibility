## What Happened

1. **Schema v2.4** defines correct field names:
   - `implements_designs`
   - `realized_through_protocols`

2. **Both prompts** used incorrect field names:
   - `design_context`
   - `uses_protocols`

3. **Claude followed prompts** precisely:
   - Created Methods with incorrect field names
   - Pass 2 would have validated them (if run)

4. **Pass 3 validation** caught the errors:
   - Compared against schema
   - Found 26 critical failures
   - Enabled root cause investigation

5. **All corrections applied**:
   - Both prompts corrected
   - Extraction corrected
   - Re-validation: PASS status

---

## Why This Matters

**Prompt Authority:** Runtime prompts have highest priority during extraction, overriding schema and skill documentation.

**Safety Net:** Pass 3 validation against schema is essential quality gate.

**Prevention:** Corrected prompts ensure future extractions are schema-compliant from the start.

## What To Do

### Now
✅ Use the corrected extraction for your assessment  
✅ You're done - everything is validated and ready

### Next Time
✅ Use corrected Pass 1 prompt  
✅ Use corrected Pass 2 prompt  
✅ Run Pass 3 validation as usual

### Going Forward
- Keep corrected prompts as your templates
- Check field names if you modify prompts
- Always run Pass 3 validation
