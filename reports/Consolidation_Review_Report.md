## Consolidation 1: System Preparation Workflow

### What Was Consolidated

**P009 (Original):** System setup and configuration protocol  
**P010 (Original):** Map preparation protocol  
**P009 (Consolidated):** System preparation workflow: server and client setup, map preprocessing (tiling, pyramids), and distribution

### Original Items Detail

#### P009 - System Setup
```
Protocol: System setup and configuration protocol
Activities:
  - Server configuration
  - Client device configuration
Time Investment:
  - 2017: 3 hours
  - 2018: 1 hour (reusing equipment)
```

#### P010 - Map Preparation
```
Protocol: Map preparation protocol  
Activities:
  - Map tiling
  - Adding pyramids
  - File compression
  - Server upload
  - Device download
Time Investment:
  - 2017: 1.5h prep + 2.5h transfer = 4 hours
  - 2018: 0.5h prep + 1.5h transfer = 2 hours
```

### Consolidated Item

#### P009 - System Preparation Workflow (Complete)
```
Protocol: System preparation workflow: server and client setup, 
          map preprocessing (tiling, pyramids), and distribution

Description:
  Complete system preparation across both seasons.
  
  2017: 3h setup + 4h map prep = 7h total
    - 3h server/client setup
    - 1.5h map tiling/pyramids
    - 2.5h file compression/transfer
  
  2018: 1h setup + 2h map prep = 3h total
    - 1h reuse setup
    - 0.5h map prep
    - 1.5h transfer
  
  Activities:
    - Server configuration
    - Client device configuration
    - Map tiling
    - Pyramid generation
    - File compression
    - Server upload
    - Device download

Year-over-year efficiency: 7h → 3h (57% reduction)
```

### Assessment Question

**"Would I assess system setup and map preparation together or separately?"**

**Answer:** Together

**Rationale:**
- Both are sequential steps in the same pre-deployment workflow
- Assessed as a unified concern: "Was the system adequately prepared for field deployment?"
- Not evaluated separately because:
  - You can't do map prep without system setup
  - Both must work together for successful field deployment
  - Failures in either step would require reassessing the entire preparation process
- Consolidation improves coherence while preserving all timing and activity details

### Information Preserved

✅ **All time measurements:**
- 2017: 3h setup, 1.5h tiling, 2.5h transfer = 7h total
- 2018: 1h setup, 0.5h tiling, 1.5h transfer = 3h total

✅ **All activities:**
- Setup: server config, client config
- Preparation: tiling, pyramids, compression, upload, download

✅ **Year-over-year comparison:**
- Efficiency improvement documented (7h → 3h)
- Equipment reuse benefit captured

✅ **Granularity available:**
- Original separation preserved in metadata
- Source items traceable via consolidated_from

### Alternative Viewpoint

**Could argue for keeping separate if:**
- You wanted to assess setup and map preparation as independent capabilities
- Different staff handled these steps and needed separate evaluation
- System setup was highly technical while map prep was administrative

**Counter-argument:**
- Text shows these were handled by same project staff
- Both part of "system preparation" narrative in Methods section
- No evidence of different quality concerns for each

**Decision confidence:** High ✅

## Consolidation 2: Interface Design Specifications

### What Was Consolidated

**P012 (Original):** Interface design specifications - dual view system  
**P013 (Original):** Interface design specifications - control minimization  
**P012 (Consolidated):** Interface design specifications: dual-view system (map/form toggle) with minimalist control set

### Original Items Detail

#### P012 - Dual View System
```
Protocol: Interface design specifications - dual view system

Design: 
  - Volunteers toggle between map view and form view
  
Map View Functions:
  - Layer focus adjustment
  - Layer visibility control
  - Pan
  - Zoom  
  - Shape digitisation

Form View Functions:
  - Attribute creation
  - Attribute editing
  - Data entry

Interaction: Toggle between views
```

#### P013 - Control Minimization
```
Protocol: Interface design specifications - control minimization

Exposed Controls:
  - Layer management
  - Map navigation
  - Record search and retrieval
  - Shape creation and editing
  - Attribute creation and editing

Hidden Functions:
  - Non-digitisation GIS features

Staff-Only Functions:
  - Infrastructure setup
  - Layer management (configuration)
  - Data aggregation
  - Export
  - Backup

Design Principles:
  - Strip to essentials
  - Hide/eliminate non-essential features
  - Concentrate complexity in staff roles
  - Reduce cognitive load
```

### Consolidated Item

#### P012 - Interface Design Specifications (Complete)
```
Protocol: Interface design specifications: dual-view system 
          (map/form toggle) with minimalist control set

Description:
  Streamlined interface with two complementary design principles:
  
  (1) Dual-view system:
      - Volunteers toggle between map view and form view
      - Map view: layer control, pan, zoom, shape digitisation
      - Form view: attribute creation/editing
  
  (2) Control minimization:
      - Only essential controls exposed
      - Non-digitisation GIS features hidden/eliminated
      - Infrastructure functions restricted to staff

Exposed Controls (5):
  - Layer management
  - Map navigation
  - Record search and retrieval
  - Shape creation and editing
  - Attribute creation and editing

Hidden Functions:
  - All non-digitisation GIS features

Staff-Only Functions:
  - Infrastructure setup
  - Layer configuration
  - Data aggregation
  - Export
  - Backup

Design Principles:
  - Minimize cognitive load
  - Strip to essentials
  - Hide non-essential features
  - Concentrate complexity in staff roles
```

### Assessment Question

**"Would I assess dual-view system and control minimization together or separately?"**

**Answer:** Together

**Rationale:**
- Both are complementary aspects of the unified interface design approach
- Assessed as integrated concern: "Was the interface design appropriate for novice users?"
- Not evaluated separately because:
  - Both serve the same goal: simplify volunteer experience
  - Dual-view without minimization wouldn't reduce cognitive load
  - Minimization without thoughtful organization (views) wouldn't be usable
  - They work together to create the usability outcome
- Consolidation creates more coherent description of interface design philosophy

### Information Preserved

✅ **All view specifications:**
- Map view: 5 functions documented
- Form view: 3 functions documented  
- Toggle mechanism described

✅ **All control categorizations:**
- Exposed: 5 control types listed
- Hidden: non-digitisation features noted
- Staff-only: 5 functions enumerated

✅ **All design principles:**
- Cognitive load reduction
- Essential-only exposure
- Feature hiding/elimination
- Complexity concentration

✅ **Granularity available:**
- Original separation preserved in metadata
- Dual-view and minimization aspects distinguishable in consolidated text

### Alternative Viewpoint

**Could argue for keeping separate if:**
- Dual-view system and control minimization represented different design phases
- Different designers made these decisions
- You wanted to assess "view architecture" separately from "control philosophy"
- Different usability principles applied to each

**Counter-argument:**
- Text presents these as unified interface design approach
- Both motivated by same usability goal (novice user accessibility)
- Both implemented together in single customization
- Methods section describes them as integrated system
- Separation would create artificial boundaries in assessment

**Decision confidence:** High ✅

## Items That Were NOT Consolidated

### Why Research Designs Stayed Separate (5 items)

**RD001** - Research goal (feature extraction from maps)  
**RD002** - Crowdsourcing decision  
**RD003** - Mobile platform choice  
**RD004** - Division of labor design  
**RD005** - Evaluation approach

**Rationale for separation:**
- Each represents distinct strategic decision with different rationale
- Assessed separately: "Was the research goal appropriate?" vs "Was crowdsourcing the right approach?" vs "Was mobile platform justified?"
- Different theoretical frameworks (RD003 has HCI theory, others don't)
- Different reasoning approaches (abductive vs deductive vs inductive)
- Opportunistic timing differs (RD005 emerged mid-project)

**Acid test:** Would you assess these design decisions together or separately?  
**Answer:** Separately - each strategic choice needs independent evaluation

---

### Why Methods Stayed Separate (7 items)

**M001** - Feature identification from map symbols  
**M002** - Crowdsourcing with students  
**M003** - Platform selection  
**M004** - FAIMS Mobile customization  
**M005** - Interface design  
**M006** - Time tracking  
**M007** - Error sampling

**Rationale for separation:**
- Each represents distinct methodological approach
- Different method types: data_collection, tool_selection, tool_development, interface_design, measurement, quality_assessment
- Assessed separately: "Was feature identification appropriate?" vs "Was crowdsourcing well-executed?" vs "Was platform selection justified?"
- Different sampling strategies where applicable
- Different protocols implement each method

**Acid test:** Would you assess these methods together or separately?  
**Answer:** Separately - each tactical approach needs independent evaluation

---

### Why These Protocols Stayed Separate (11 items after 2 consolidations)

**P001** - Map material specifications  
**P002** - Target symbol specifications  
**P003** - Volunteer training  
**P004** - Volunteer supervision  
**P005** - Work environment/timing  
**P006** - Platform evaluation criteria  
**P007** - Development protocol  
**P008** - Seven-stage workflow  
**P011** - Automated capabilities  
**P014** - Time tracking sources  
**P015** - Error checking

**Rationale for separation:**

#### P001 vs P002 (Map specs vs Target specs)
- Different specification domains
- Separate replication concerns: map accuracy vs feature definitions
- Assessed separately: "Were maps adequate?" vs "Were target criteria clear?"

#### P003 vs P004 (Training vs Supervision)
- One-time vs ongoing protocols
- Different assessment: "Was training sufficient?" vs "Was ongoing support adequate?"
- Different time investments: minutes vs 30 min/season

#### P007 vs P008 (Development vs Workflow)
- Who did it vs what stages involved
- Different concerns: "Was developer appropriate?" vs "Were workflow stages complete?"

#### P011 (Automation) - Unique capabilities
- Distinct protocol about system automation features
- Assessed for: "Did automation support data quality and volunteer productivity?"
- No other protocol covers this domain

**Acid test:** Would you assess these protocols together or separately?  
**Answer:** Separately - each operational procedure has distinct replication concerns

---

## Consolidation Could Have Been More Aggressive

### Candidate: P007 + P008 → "Development and Workflow Protocol"

**P007** - Customization development (who, time, cost)  
**P008** - Seven-stage workflow (what stages)

**Why this wasn't consolidated:**
- P007 answers "Who developed it and how long?"
- P008 answers "What were the implementation stages?"
- Can assess developer adequacy separately from workflow completeness
- Different replication concerns

**Could consolidate if:**
- You view development and workflow as inseparable aspects of "how customization happened"
- Assessment question: "Was the development process appropriate?" (combines both)

**Why staying separate is defensible:**
- P007 resource-focused (35h programmer, AUD $2k)
- P008 process-focused (7 stages, role assignments)
- Separate allows evaluating: "Could another project afford this?" vs "Are workflow stages complete?"

**Recommendation:** **Keep separate** - different assessment concerns

---

### Candidate: P003 + P004 → "Volunteer Support Protocol"

**P003** - Training (minutes required, minimal skills)  
**P004** - Supervision (30 min/season, minimal ongoing)

**Why this wasn't consolidated:**
- P003 one-time competency development
- P004 ongoing performance support
- Different temporal characteristics
- Different assessment questions

**Could consolidate if:**
- You view training and supervision as unified "volunteer support strategy"
- Assessment question: "Was volunteer support adequate?" (combines both)

**Why staying separate is defensible:**
- Training failure vs supervision failure have different implications
- Initial competency vs sustained performance are separate concerns
- Project planning needs these as separate time estimates

**Recommendation:** **Keep separate** - temporal and functional differences matter

---

## Consolidation Rate Analysis

### Target: 15-20% Reduction

**Achieved: 7.4% reduction (2 of 27 items)**

### Why Below Target is Appropriate

**1. Pass 1 was well-scoped**
- Methods section naturally more structured than discussion sections
- Minimal over-extraction to consolidate
- Liberal extraction appropriately restrained by clear boundaries

**2. Granularity matches assessment needs**
- Each remaining item represents distinct assessment concern
- Protocol-level detail essential for replication
- Method-level distinctions meaningful for approach evaluation

**3. Section type variation**
- Methods sections: more precise, less redundant than Discussion
- Discussion sections: more measurement-dense, more consolidation opportunities
- Pass 2 prompt explicitly notes "may vary by section type"

**4. Conservative better than aggressive**
- Information loss worse than extra items
- Under-consolidation preservable, over-consolidation irreversible
- Assessment can always group items; can't un-merge them

### Comparison to Discussion Section

**Discussion (Claims/Evidence) Pass 2:**
- 56.2% reduction (89 → 39 items)
- Many redundant calculations
- Over-granular threshold presentations
- Measurement-heavy with natural consolidation opportunities

**Methods (RDMAP) Pass 2:**
- 7.4% reduction (27 → 25 items)
- Distinct methodological procedures
- Clear boundaries between approaches
- Minimal redundancy in Pass 1

**Takeaway:** Different section types warrant different reduction targets

## Recommendations for Future Extractions

### 1. Section-Specific Targets
- Don't force uniform reduction percentages
- Methods: expect 5-15% (more structured, less redundant)
- Discussion: expect 15-25% (more measurement-dense, more consolidation)
- Results: expect 20-30% (often over-granular reporting)

### 2. Workflow vs Component Distinction
- Sequential workflow steps → strong consolidation candidates (P009+P010)
- Complementary design principles → good consolidation candidates (P012+P013)
- Parallel procedures → usually keep separate (P003/P004)
- Different domains → always keep separate (P001/P002)

### 3. Temporal Characteristics Matter
- One-time vs ongoing protocols → keep separate
- Sequential vs simultaneous activities → consolidate sequential
- Different seasons/phases → document but may consolidate

### 4. The Acid Test Works
- "Assess together or separately?" consistently guides good decisions
- When answer is "could go either way" → keep separate (conservative)
- Only consolidate when answer is clearly "together"

### 5. Protocol-Level Preservation
- Protocols contain replication-critical details
- Minimal consolidation at protocol tier is correct
- Details like "35h", "AUD $2k", "3h setup" essential for feasibility assessment
- Don't sacrifice precision for reduction percentage
