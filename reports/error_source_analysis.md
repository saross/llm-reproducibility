# Error Source Analysis Report
## Field Naming Issue: design_context vs implements_designs

**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Investigation Scope:** Schema, Skill, Project Files, Prompts

---

## Summary

**Finding:** The incorrect field names (`design_context` and `uses_protocols`) originated from **the runtime extraction prompts**, not from the schema or skill.

---

## Investigation Results

### ✓ Schema (extraction_schema.json) - CLEARED

**Status:** Clean - has correct field names

**Evidence:**
```json
"implements_designs": {
  "type": "array",
  "items": {"type": "string"},
  "description": "Research design IDs this method implements"
}

"realized_through_protocols": {
  "type": "array", 
  "items": {"type": "string"},
  "description": "Protocol IDs that realize this method"
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✓ JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
- ✓ `implements_designs` present and correctly defined
- ✓ `realized_through_protocols` present and correctly defined
- ✓ `design_context` NOT present (good)
- ✓ `uses_protocols` NOT present (good)

**Conclusion:** Schema v2.4 uses correct field names throughout.

---

### ✓ Research-Assessor Skill - CLEARED

**Status:** Clean - references correct field names

**Evidence from skill documentation:**

File: `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/schema/schema-guide.md`
- Line 169: `implements_designs`: Which designs this method implements
- Line 170: `realized_through_protocols`: Which protocols implement this method

File: `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/examples/sobotkova-example.md`
```json
"implements_designs": ["RD001"],
"realized_through_protocols": ["P023", "P024", "P025"]
```

**Search results:**
- ✓ `implements_designs` found in 3 locations (all correct)
- ✓ `realized_through_protocols` found in 3 locations (all correct)
- ✓ `design_context` found in 0 locations (good)
- ✓ `uses_protocols` found in 0 locations (good)

**Conclusion:** Skill documentation and examples use correct field names consistently.

---

### ✓ Project Files - CLEARED

**Status:** Clean - no incorrect field names found

**Search results:**
- ✓ `design_context` found in 0 project files
- ✓ `uses_protocols` found in 0 project files

**Conclusion:** Project documentation and prompts (in /mnt/project/) are clean.

---

## Root Cause: RDMAP Pass 1 Prompt ✗

**ERROR LOCATED:** The RDMAP Pass 1 Liberal Extraction Prompt contains incorrect field names in its instructions.

### Specific Errors Found

**File:** `rdmap_pass1_prompt.md`

**Line 44 (Quality Checklist):**
```markdown
- [ ] Cross-references populated (`enables_methods`, `uses_protocols`, etc.)
```
❌ Should be: `realized_through_protocols`

**Line 244 (Cross-Referencing Section):**
```markdown
- Research Designs `enables_methods` → Methods `design_context`
```
❌ Should be: `implements_designs`

**Line 245 (Cross-Referencing Section):**
```markdown
- Methods `uses_protocols` → Protocols `implements_method`
```
❌ Should be: `realized_through_protocols`

**Line 280 (Workflow Step 4):**
```markdown
- Update `design_context` and `implements_method` fields
```
❌ Should be: `implements_designs`

### Impact Analysis

**What Claude did:** 
- Followed the prompt instructions precisely
- Used `design_context` in all 7 Methods (as instructed on line 244)
- Used `uses_protocols` in all 7 Methods (as instructed on line 245)
- Applied consistently across entire extraction

**Good news:**
- ✓ No JSON examples in prompt used wrong names (examples were minimal)
- ✓ Claude's extraction was internally consistent
- ✓ All cross-reference data is correct, just labeled wrong
- ✓ Simple find-replace in prompt will fix for future extractions

### Why This Matters

The prompt is the **single source of truth** for field naming during extraction. Even though:
- Schema v2.4 has correct names ✓
- Skill documentation has correct names ✓
- Skill examples have correct names ✓

...the runtime prompt **overrides** all of these by giving explicit instructions.

Claude prioritized the immediate prompt instructions over schema/skill documentation, which is correct behavior but amplified the prompt error.

---

## How This Happened

### Architecture Context

The research-assessor skill uses a separation-of-concerns architecture:

**Skill package contains:**
- Core decision frameworks (unchanging)
- Schema definitions (version-controlled)
- Reference materials (stable)

**User provides at runtime:**
- Extraction prompts for each pass (evolving)
- Source material (paper sections)
- JSON document (template or partially populated)

**Why?** Extraction prompts evolve rapidly through testing. This architecture allows prompt tuning without versioning conflicts.

### The Problem

One of the runtime prompts (Pass 1 or Pass 2 for RDMAP) must have:
1. Referenced the wrong field names, OR
2. Provided an example with wrong field names, OR
3. Had ambiguous wording that led Claude to choose different field names

---

## Evidence from Extraction

The extraction (`sobotkova_rdmap_pass2_complete.json`) shows:

**All 7 Methods consistently use:**
```json
{
  "method_id": "M00X",
  "design_context": [...],      // ← Should be "implements_designs"
  "uses_protocols": [...],      // ← Should be "realized_through_protocols"
  ...
}
```

**Observations:**
- ✓ Field naming is **consistent** across all 7 methods
- ✓ The **data** is correct (all IDs are valid and bidirectionally consistent)
- ✓ Only the **field labels** are wrong

This suggests:
- The prompt explicitly used these field names, OR
- Claude interpreted the prompt and chose these names consistently

---

## Next Steps

### Investigation Continues

**Please provide the RDMAP prompts in order:**
1. RDMAP Pass 1 Liberal Extraction Prompt
2. RDMAP Pass 2 Rationalization Prompt

We'll check each one to find where `design_context` and `uses_protocols` originated.

### Expected Findings

Most likely scenarios (in order of probability):

1. **Example in prompt used wrong field names**
   - Prompt shows example method with `design_context` instead of `implements_designs`
   - Claude faithfully replicated the example format

2. **Field names specified incorrectly in prompt instructions**
   - Prompt text says "use design_context to reference..." instead of "use implements_designs"
   
3. **Ambiguous wording allowed Claude to choose names**
   - Prompt says "add a field for design context" without specifying exact field name
   - Claude chose `design_context` as seemingly reasonable interpretation

### Fixes Required

**In `rdmap_pass1_prompt.md`:**

1. **Line 44:** Change `uses_protocols` → `realized_through_protocols`
2. **Line 244:** Change `design_context` → `implements_designs`
3. **Line 245:** Change `uses_protocols` → `realized_through_protocols`
4. **Line 280:** Change `design_context` → `implements_designs`

**Note:** Pass 2 prompt analyzed - confirmed same errors present

### Pass 2 Prompt Analysis ✗

**File:** `rdmap_pass2_prompt.md`

**2 errors found:**
1. **Line 190:** `methods[].design_context` (should be `methods[].implements_designs`)
2. **Line 194:** `methods[].uses_protocols` (should be `methods[].realized_through_protocols`)

**Details:**

**Line 190 (Cross-Reference Validation):**
```markdown
❌ research_designs[].enables_methods ↔ methods[].design_context
✓  research_designs[].enables_methods ↔ methods[].implements_designs
```

**Line 194 (Cross-Reference Validation):**
```markdown
❌ methods[].uses_protocols ↔ protocols[].implements_method
✓  methods[].realized_through_protocols ↔ protocols[].implements_method
```

**Impact:** Pass 2 rationalization would have validated incorrect field names, propagating the error forward

**Status:** ✓ Corrected - rdmap_pass2_prompt_corrected.md created

### Prevention Strategies

1. ✓ **Corrected prompt created** (see rdmap_pass1_prompt_corrected.md)
2. **Add validation step** - Check field names match schema before starting extraction
3. **Skill documentation note** - Add common mistakes section
4. **Prompt template** - Create authoritative template with correct field names
5. **Cross-check process** - Validate prompts against schema before use

---

## Good News

Despite the field naming error:
- ✓ All 64 objects extracted correctly
- ✓ All cross-references logically sound
- ✓ All consolidations properly documented
- ✓ Schema is correct
- ✓ Skill documentation is correct
- ✓ Simple field rename resolved all issues
- ✓ No re-extraction needed

The extraction quality is high - this was purely a technical field naming issue.

---

## Validation Notes

**JSON Validation:** No syntax errors found in extraction_schema.json
- No missing square brackets
- No trailing commas
- No unclosed objects
- Valid JSON structure throughout

**Schema Version:** 2.4 (correct and up-to-date)

---

Ready to examine the RDMAP extraction prompts to pinpoint the exact source of the field naming error.

## INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - FINAL SUMMARY

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ✓✓ ALL ERROR SOURCES IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED

### Error Sources Summary

| Source | Errors Found | Lines Affected | Status |
|--------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Schema (extraction_schema.json) | 0 | N/A | ✓ Clean |
| Skill (research-assessor) | 0 | N/A | ✓ Clean |
| **Pass 1 Prompt** | **4** | 44, 244, 245, 280 | ✓ Corrected |
| **Pass 2 Prompt** | **2** | 190, 194 | ✓ Corrected |
| Pass 3 Prompt | 0 | N/A | ✓ Clean |

**Total Errors:** 6 field naming mistakes across 2 runtime prompts

### Field Name Errors Found

**Incorrect (used in prompts):**
- `design_context` → Should be `implements_designs`
- `uses_protocols` → Should be `realized_through_protocols`

**Impact:**
- Pass 1: Instructed Claude to CREATE Methods with incorrect field names
- Pass 2: Would have VALIDATED incorrect field names during rationalization
- Result: All 7 Methods in extraction used incorrect field names
- Detection: Pass 3 validation caught all 26 critical failures

### Corrections Applied

**Pass 1 Prompt (4 corrections):**
1. Line 44: `uses_protocols` → `realized_through_protocols`
2. Line 244: `design_context` → `implements_designs`
3. Line 245: `uses_protocols` → `realized_through_protocols`
4. Line 280: `design_context` → `implements_designs`

**Pass 2 Prompt (2 corrections):**
1. Line 190: `methods[].design_context` → `methods[].implements_designs`
2. Line 194: `methods[].uses_protocols` → `methods[].realized_through_protocols`

**Extraction (14 corrections):**
- Renamed fields in all 7 Methods
- Re-validated: PASS status achieved (0 critical issues)

### Files Generated

**Corrected Prompts (For Future Use):**
1. rdmap_pass1_prompt_corrected.md
2. rdmap_pass2_prompt_corrected.md

**Corrected Extraction (Ready for Assessment):**
3. sobotkova_rdmap_pass2_corrected.json

**Complete Documentation:**
4. error_source_analysis.md (this file)
5. rdmap_pass1_correction_summary.md
6. rdmap_pass2_correction_summary.md
7. complete_investigation_summary.md
8. validation_summary.md

### Root Cause

**Why this happened:**
- Schema v2.4 uses correct field names (`implements_designs`, `realized_through_protocols`)
- Both Pass 1 and Pass 2 prompts used older/different field names
- Prompts never updated to match schema v2.4
- Runtime prompts have higher authority than schema during extraction
- Claude correctly followed prompt instructions (even though they were wrong)

**Why it matters:**
- Demonstrates importance of prompt/schema version synchronization
- Shows value of schema-based validation as safety net
- Highlights need for field name validation in extraction workflow

### Prevention

**Immediate:**
- ✓ Use corrected prompts for all future extractions
- ✓ Archive original prompts as deprecated

**Long-term:**
- Add field name validation to Pass 1 or Pass 2
- Maintain prompt/schema version compatibility matrix
- Test prompts against schema before production use
- Periodic prompt audits for schema alignment

### Conclusion

All error sources identified and corrected. Schema and skill were always correct. Both RDMAP extraction prompts (Pass 1 and Pass 2) contained field naming errors that caused validation failures. All corrections validated and ready for use.

**Investigation Status: COMPLETE ✓✓**
