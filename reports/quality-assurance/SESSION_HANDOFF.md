## CURRENT FILE STATUS

### Files in Outputs Directory (Corrected Versions)

**Prompts:**
- ✅ `claims-evidence_pass2_prompt_v2.5_corrected.md` - Ready to deploy
- ✅ `rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md` - Ready to deploy (streamlined)

**Skill:**

### Files That Need Fixing (Current Versions May Be Outdated)

**Schema:**
- ⚠️ `extraction_schema.json` - Missing RDMAP status fields and implicit fields

**Prompts (Original Versions):**
- ⚠️ `claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md` - Needs standardized skill references
- ⚠️ `rdmap_pass1_prompt.md` - Needs standardized skill references
- ⚠️ `rdmap_pass2_prompt.md` - Needs extraction-fundamentals reference added

**Skill References:**
- ⚠️ `verification-procedures.md` - Missing entire RDMAP section
- ⚠️ `schema-guide.md` - Still v2.4, needs v2.5 update

**Note:** Original prompt files were uploaded but may not be in outputs directory. May need to be re-uploaded or referenced from project knowledge in new chat.

## PRIORITY ISSUES TO FIX (In Order)

### PHASE 1: BLOCKING (Must Do Before Deployment)

**1. Fix extraction_schema.json (2-3 hours)**
- Add status fields: `design_status`, `method_status`, `protocol_status` to RDMAP objects
- Add implicit fields: `trigger_text`, `trigger_locations`, `inference_reasoning`, `implicit_metadata`
- Change `source_items` → `consolidated_from` in consolidation_metadata
- Verify `source_verification` object exists for RDMAP objects

**2. Add RDMAP section to verification-procedures.md (2 hours)**
- Location: /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/verification-procedures.md
- Add Part 3: Verification for RDMAP Objects
- Include explicit and implicit RDMAP procedures
- Add worked examples
- Renumber subsequent parts

**3. Update schema-guide.md to v2.5 (1-2 hours)**
- Location: /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/schema/schema-guide.md
- Change v2.4 → v2.5
- Document all v2.5 sourcing requirements
- Add RDMAP explicit vs implicit sections
- Add worked example of implicit RDMAP

**4. Standardize skill references (30 min)**
- Update all 5 prompts to use consistent format
- First mention: `**READ FIRST:** /full/path`
- Subsequent: `→ See references/file.md`

**5. Add skill invocation to Pass 3 start (15 min)**
- Add prominent READ FIRST section to rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md

**6. Add extraction-fundamentals to Pass 2 prompts (30 min)**
- Both claims-evidence and RDMAP Pass 2 prompts
- Brief reminder section about sourcing discipline

**7. Standardize quality checklists (1 hour)**
- Create consistent structure across all 5 prompts

---

## KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. **Field naming:** Use `consolidated_from` everywhere (more descriptive than `source_items`)

2. **Skill reference format:** Standardize to:
   - First: `**READ FIRST:** /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/file.md`
   - Later: `→ See references/file.md`

3. **Status field values:** Use "explicit" | "implicit" enum

4. **RDMAP implicit basis:** Two types: "mentioned_undocumented" | "inferred_from_results"

5. **Prompt streamlining approach:** Keep WHAT and HOW to report, reference skill for detailed procedures

## TO RESUME IN NEW CHAT

### Required Context

**Upload these files from outputs:**
1. QA_REPORT_COMPREHENSIVE.md
2. QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md  
3. SESSION_HANDOFF.md (this file)

**Files needed for editing:**
- extraction_schema.json (current version from uploads)
- rdmap_pass1_prompt.md (original from uploads)
- rdmap_pass2_prompt.md (original from uploads)
- claims-evidence_pass1_prompt.md (original from uploads)

**From skill:** (access via /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/)
- references/verification-procedures.md
- references/schema/schema-guide.md

**Already in outputs (corrected versions):**
- rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md
- claims-evidence_pass2_prompt_v2.5_corrected.md

### Opening Message Template

```
I need to continue remediation work from a previous QA review. 

Context from previous session:
- Completed comprehensive QA of extraction workflow (5 prompts + schema + skill)
- Found 11 critical issues blocking deployment
- Created detailed remediation plan

Files attached:
- QA_REPORT_COMPREHENSIVE.md (full analysis)
- QA_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md (step-by-step fixes)
- SESSION_HANDOFF.md (continuity document)
- extraction_schema.json (needs RDMAP fields added)
- [prompt files that need fixing]

Please review the remediation plan and help me execute Phase 1 fixes in priority order. Start with fixing extraction_schema.json to add the missing RDMAP fields.
```

## CRITICAL THINGS NOT TO LOSE

1. **Three show-stopper issues:**
   - verification-procedures.md missing RDMAP section
   - schema-guide.md still v2.4
   - Schema missing RDMAP status fields

2. **Corrected prompt versions:**
   - rdmap_pass3_prompt_v2.5.md (streamlined)
   - claims-evidence_pass2_prompt_v2.5_corrected.md (source verification expanded)

3. **Skills architecture decision:**
   - extraction-fundamentals.md covers universal sourcing (Pass 1 & 2)
   - verification-procedures.md covers validation (Pass 3)
   - Progressive disclosure via skill references

4. **Field structure decisions:**
   - Status: "explicit" | "implicit"
   - Implicit metadata: basis, transparency_gap, assessability_impact, reconstruction_confidence
   - Trigger infrastructure: trigger_text array + trigger_locations array + inference_reasoning

---

## TESTING CHECKLIST (After Fixes)

- [ ] Schema validates test extraction
- [ ] End-to-end extraction works (Pass 1 → 2 → 3)
- [ ] All skill file references resolve correctly
- [ ] Source verification catches known bad extractions
- [ ] Cross-references work bidirectionally
- [ ] Quality checklists consistent across prompts
- [ ] Field names match between schema and prompts

---

## NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

- Original uploaded prompts may not be in outputs - check project knowledge
- Skill can be accessed at /mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/ (persistent)
- Use skill-creator skill for packaging if needed
- Estimated 6-8 hours to complete Phase 1 (blocking issues)
- After Phase 1, run test extraction before proceeding to Phase 2
