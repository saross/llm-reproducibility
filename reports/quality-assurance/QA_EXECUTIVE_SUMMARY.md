# QA Executive Summary - CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ DO NOT DEPLOY - Critical issues found

---

## TOP 3 SHOW-STOPPERS

### 1. ðŸ”´ verification-procedures.md MISSING RDMAP SECTION

**Problem:** Pass 3 prompt tells validators to read verification-procedures.md for RDMAP verification, but **the file has no RDMAP section**.

**Why critical:** Pass 3 validation of RDMAP cannot be done correctly without procedures

**Fix required:** Add ~100-150 line section covering RDMAP verification procedures

---

### 2. ðŸ”´ schema-guide.md IS STILL v2.4

**Problem:** Skill's primary reference document hasn't been updated to v2.5

**Why critical:** Extractors consulting schema-guide will get outdated information that contradicts prompts

**Fix required:** Update entire schema-guide.md to v2.5 (add sourcing requirements, status fields, etc.)

---

### 3. ðŸ”´ SCHEMA MISSING RDMAP STATUS FIELDS

**Problem:** Prompts reference `design_status`, `method_status`, `protocol_status` fields that **don't exist in schema**

**Why critical:** Cannot extract fields that don't exist in schema. Schema validation will fail.

**Fix required:** Add status fields + trigger infrastructure to all RDMAP objects in extraction_schema.json

## OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES (8 more)

4. Schema missing RDMAP implicit fields (trigger_text, trigger_locations, etc.)
5. Inconsistent skill reference formatting across all prompts
6. Pass 3 doesn't invoke skill at start (verification-procedures.md not prominent)
7. Need to verify source_verification object exists for RDMAP
8. extraction-fundamentals.md not referenced in Pass 2 prompts
9. Schema missing example of implicit RDMAP object
10. Quality checklists inconsistent across prompts
11. Field name mismatch: prompts use `consolidated_from`, schema uses `source_items`

---

## WHAT WORKS WELL âœ…

- Core extraction principles are sound
- Consolidation patterns well-thought-out
- extraction-fundamentals.md is excellent
- Progressive disclosure architecture is correct
- Pass 2 sourcing guidance comprehensive

---

## REQUIRED ACTION BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

**Must fix (6-8 hours):**
1. Add RDMAP verification section to verification-procedures.md
2. Update schema-guide.md to v2.5
3. Add missing fields to extraction_schema.json
4. Standardize skill references across prompts
5. Add extraction-fundamentals reference to Pass 2 prompts
6. Standardize quality checklists

**Cannot deploy without these fixes.**
