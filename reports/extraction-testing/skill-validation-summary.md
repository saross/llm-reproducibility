- ✅ Schema: extraction_schema.json, schema-guide.md
- ✅ Decision frameworks: tier-assignment-guide.md, consolidation-patterns.md, expected-information.md
- ✅ Examples: sobotkova-example.md
- ✅ Navigation: README.md (operational, not auxiliary)

**Resource Quality:**
- ✅ All files support AI agent decision-making
- ✅ No duplication with SKILL.md
- ✅ Appropriate granularity and organization
- ✅ Clear loading triggers documented in SKILL.md

## Quality Metrics

### Token Efficiency

**Before Corrections:**
- SKILL.md: 232 lines
- References: ~6,028 lines
- Auxiliary docs: 497 lines (REMOVED)
- **Total:** ~6,757 lines

**After Corrections:**
- SKILL.md: 232 lines
- References: ~6,028 lines
- Auxiliary docs: 0 lines
- **Total:** 6,260 lines

**Improvement:**
- 497 lines removed (7.4% reduction)
- 100% of auxiliary documentation eliminated
- Zero context bloat from non-operational content

### Package Size

**Before:** 48 KB  
**After:** 44 KB  
**Reduction:** 4 KB (8.3%)

### Compliance

**Before:** 7/9 criteria passing  
**After:** 9/9 criteria passing  
**Improvement:** 100% compliance achieved

## What Was Corrected

### Issue 1: PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem:** 302-line auxiliary documentation file
- **Action:** Deleted
- **Impact:** Eliminates packaging metadata irrelevant to operation
- **Tokens saved:** ~200 tokens (if loaded)

### Issue 2: VERSION_HISTORY.md ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Problem:** 195-line changelog/version history
- **Action:** Deleted
- **Impact:** Removes historical information not needed for task execution
- **Tokens saved:** ~130 tokens (if loaded)

### Issue 3: Erroneous Directory ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Literal `{schema,checklists,examples}/` directory name
- **Action:** Deleted
- **Impact:** Cleans up packaging artifact, prevents confusion
- **Structure:** Cleaner, no spurious paths

---

## Final Architecture Validation

### Separation of Concerns ✅

**Skill Package (Stable):**
- Decision frameworks (tier assignment, consolidation)
- Schema definitions (object structures)
- Reference materials (examples, checklists)
- Core extraction principles

**Runtime Prompts (User-Provided, Evolving):**
- Pass 1 prompts (claims/evidence, RDMAP)
- Pass 2 prompts (rationalization)
- Pass 3 prompt (validation)

**Why This Works:**
- Prompts evolve through testing → no skill repackaging needed
- Frameworks remain stable → skill provides consistent foundation
- Users control prompt versions → maximum flexibility
- Zero versioning conflicts → independent evolution

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern ✅

**Level 1 - Metadata (Always loaded):**
- name: "research-assessor"
- description: "Extracts and assesses research methodology..."
- ~20 tokens

**Level 2 - SKILL.md (When triggered):**
- Core workflow overview
- Usage instructions
- Decision frameworks summary
- Reference file indicators
- ~1,500 tokens

**Level 3 - References (As needed):**
- extraction-fundamentals.md (~300 lines, when extracting Pass 1/2)
- verification-procedures.md (~1,524 lines, when validating Pass 3)
- schema-guide.md (~518 lines, when uncertain about structure)
- Other files as needed
- Variable tokens (load only what's needed)

## Deployment Readiness

### Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

- ✅ SKILL.md validated (proper frontmatter, clear instructions)
- ✅ All reference files present and accessible
- ✅ Directory structure correct
- ✅ No extraneous files
- ✅ No structural artifacts
- ✅ Package integrity verified
- ✅ Compliance confirmed (9/9 criteria)

### Installation Instructions

**For User:**
1. Extract `research-assessor-v2.5-corrected.tar.gz`
2. Place `research-assessor-packaged/` in Claude's skills directory
3. Rename to `research-assessor/` (remove "-packaged" suffix)
4. Verify permissions (read access for all files)

**For Claude:**
- Skill will auto-trigger on methodology extraction requests
- Metadata always in context (progressive disclosure)
- References loaded as needed
- User provides extraction prompts at runtime

### Testing Recommendations

**Quick Test:**
1. Request: "Extract methodology from this paper" (with paper attached)
2. Verify: Claude loads SKILL.md and appropriate references
3. Check: JSON output matches schema
4. Validate: Sourcing requirements followed

**Full Test:**
1. Complete Pass 1 (claims/evidence)
2. Complete Pass 2 (consolidation)
3. Complete Pass 1 (RDMAP)
4. Complete Pass 2 (RDMAP consolidation)
5. Complete Pass 3 (validation)
6. Verify: All arrays populated correctly, cross-references valid
