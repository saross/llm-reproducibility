## 🔄 Consolidations Performed

### 1. System Preparation Workflow
```
P009: System setup (3h/1h)  ┐
                            ├→ P009: Complete preparation workflow (7h/3h)
P010: Map prep (4h/2h)      ┘
```
**Why:** Sequential steps, assessed together for completeness  
**Information preserved:** ✅ Complete (all timing, all activities)

### 2. Interface Design Specifications  
```
P012: Dual-view system      ┐
                            ├→ P012: Unified interface design
P013: Control minimization  ┘
```
**Why:** Complementary principles, assessed together for usability  
**Information preserved:** ✅ Complete (all controls, all functions)

## 🎯 Why 7.4% vs 15-20% Target?

**Appropriate because:**
- ✅ Pass 1 was well-scoped (minimal over-extraction)
- ✅ Each remaining item = distinct assessment concern
- ✅ Acid test applied rigorously (assess together vs separately)
- ✅ Better to preserve granularity than force consolidations

**Items that stayed separate (and why):**
- Research Designs: 5 distinct strategic decisions
- Methods: 7 distinct tactical approaches  
- Protocols: 11 distinct operational procedures (after 2 consolidations)

## 🔗 Cross-Reference Architecture

### Verified Chains (All Bidirectional):

**Research Goal:** RD001 → M001 → P001, P002  
**Crowdsourcing:** RD002 → M002 → P003, P004, P005  
**Platform:** RD003 → M003 → P006  
**Development:** RD003, RD004 → M004 → P007, P008, P009, P011  
**Interface:** RD004 → M005 → P012  
**Evaluation:** RD005 → M006, M007 → P014, P015  

**Total links:** 13 Design→Method + 18 Method→Protocol = 31 bidirectional links ✓

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Conservative consolidation works:** Better to preserve appropriate granularity
2. **Workflow integration effective:** Sequential steps (prep) consolidated well
3. **Complementary principles integrate:** Interface design aspects unified successfully
4. **Acid test is powerful:** "Assess together or separately?" guided all decisions
5. **Cross-reference discipline pays off:** Bidirectional links ensure traceability
6. **Complete metadata essential:** Future assessors need consolidation rationale
7. **Methods sections vary:** Not all sections will hit 15-20% reduction target
