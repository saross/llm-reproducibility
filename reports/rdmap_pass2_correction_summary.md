# RDMAP Pass 2 Prompt - Error Correction Summary

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Error Source:** rdmap_pass2_prompt.md (RDMAP Pass 2 Rationalization Prompt)  
**Impact:** Would have validated incorrect field names during rationalization

---

## Executive Summary

The RDMAP Pass 2 prompt contained the **same field naming errors** as Pass 1, with incorrect field names in 2 locations within the Cross-Reference Validation section. These errors would have reinforced the use of non-schema-compliant field names during the rationalization pass.

**Good News:**
- Only 2 simple corrections needed
- Errors identical to Pass 1 (consistent error propagation)
- Corrected prompt ready for future use
- No new error patterns discovered

---

## Errors Found and Corrected

### Error 1: Line 190 (Cross-Reference Validation)

**Location:** Section 2: Cross-Reference Validation → Design → Method

**INCORRECT (original):**
```markdown
- `research_designs[].enables_methods` ↔ `methods[].design_context`
```

**CORRECT (fixed):**
```markdown
- `research_designs[].enables_methods` ↔ `methods[].implements_designs`
```

**Impact:** Instructed Claude to validate `design_context` field during rationalization
**Consequence:** Would have accepted incorrect field names as valid

---

### Error 2: Line 194 (Cross-Reference Validation)

**Location:** Section 2: Cross-Reference Validation → Method → Protocol

**INCORRECT (original):**
```markdown
- `methods[].uses_protocols` ↔ `protocols[].implements_method`
```

**CORRECT (fixed):**
```markdown
- `methods[].realized_through_protocols` ↔ `protocols[].implements_method`
```

**Impact:** Instructed Claude to validate `uses_protocols` field during rationalization
**Consequence:** Would have accepted incorrect field names as valid

---

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Consistency Across Passes

**Pass 1 Errors (4 locations):**
- Line 44: Checklist reference
- Line 244: Cross-referencing instructions
- Line 245: Cross-referencing instructions
- Line 280: Workflow instructions

**Pass 2 Errors (2 locations):**
- Line 190: Cross-reference validation
- Line 194: Cross-reference validation

**Pattern:** Both prompts used incorrect field names in their cross-reference sections, suggesting:
1. Both prompts derived from common source/template
2. Field names changed in schema without updating prompts
3. Error propagated through prompt development cycle

### Why This Matters

**Pass 2's Role:**
- Validates Pass 1 extraction
- Checks cross-reference consistency
- Would have **approved** incorrect field names

**Result:**
- Pass 1 created incorrect field names (following prompt)
- Pass 2 would have validated them (following prompt)
- Pass 3 caught the error (validating against schema)

**This confirms:** Pass 3 validation against schema is essential safety check

## Impact Assessment

### If Pass 2 Had Run With Original Prompt

**What would have happened:**
1. ✓ Pass 2 would find Pass 1's field names
2. ✓ Pass 2 prompt says to validate: `methods[].design_context`
3. ✓ Pass 2 sees `design_context` in extraction
4. ✓ Pass 2 marks cross-references as "valid"
5. ✗ Error propagates to final extraction
6. ✗ Pass 3 catches error (schema validation)

**Actual outcome:**
- You didn't run Pass 2 before validation
- Pass 3 caught errors immediately
- We traced back to source prompts

**Lesson:** Schema-based validation (Pass 3) is critical safety net

## Corrections Applied

### File: rdmap_pass2_prompt_corrected.md

**Change 1:**
```diff
- `research_designs[].enables_methods` ↔ `methods[].design_context`
+ `research_designs[].enables_methods` ↔ `methods[].implements_designs`
```

**Change 2:**
```diff
- `methods[].uses_protocols` ↔ `protocols[].implements_method`
+ `methods[].realized_through_protocols` ↔ `protocols[].implements_method`
```

**Verification:**
- ✓ No `methods[].design_context` references (except in correction note)
- ✓ No `methods[].uses_protocols` references (except in correction note)
- ✓ Correct field names now present: `implements_designs`, `realized_through_protocols`

   - Both field name errors corrected
   - Correction note added at top
   - Ready for immediate use

## Comparison: Pass 1 vs Pass 2 Errors

| Aspect | Pass 1 | Pass 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Errors found** | 4 locations | 2 locations |
| **Error type** | Instructions + checklist | Validation only |
| **Impact** | Created incorrect fields | Would validate incorrect fields |
| **Section** | Multiple sections | Cross-Reference Validation only |
| **Severity** | Primary source | Reinforcing/validation |

**Conclusion:** Pass 1 errors were more extensive (4 vs 2), but Pass 2 errors would have prevented detection during rationalization.

## Error Propagation Timeline

**Development Phase:**
1. Schema v2.4 defined correct field names (`implements_designs`, `realized_through_protocols`)
2. Prompts developed using earlier/different field names
3. Prompts never updated to match schema v2.4
4. Both Pass 1 and Pass 2 prompts contained same errors

**Extraction Phase:**
1. Pass 1 prompt instructed use of `design_context` and `uses_protocols`
2. Claude followed instructions, created extraction with incorrect field names
3. Pass 2 (if run) would have validated incorrect field names
4. Pass 3 caught errors by validating against schema

**Resolution Phase:**
1. Investigation traced errors to prompts
2. Both prompts corrected
3. Extraction fixed via field rename
4. All outputs validated and ready

## Implementation Guide

### For Current Extraction
✓ Already fixed - use `sobotkova_rdmap_pass2_corrected.json`

### For Future Extractions

**Complete Corrected Workflow:**

1. **Pass 1: Liberal Extraction**
   ```bash
   Use: rdmap_pass1_prompt_corrected.md
   Result: Extraction with correct field names
   ```

2. **Pass 2: Rationalization**
   ```bash
   Use: rdmap_pass2_prompt_corrected.md
   Result: Validates correct field names, produces rationalized extraction
   ```

3. **Pass 3: Validation**
   ```bash
   Use: rdmap_pass3_prompt.md (Pass 3 was already correct)
   Result: PASS status on first attempt
   ```

**Benefits of corrected workflow:**
- ✓ Correct field names from Pass 1
- ✓ Proper validation in Pass 2
- ✓ Clean PASS in Pass 3
- ✓ No post-extraction corrections needed

## Prevention Strategies

### Immediate Actions
1. ✓ Replace Pass 1 prompt with corrected version
2. ✓ Replace Pass 2 prompt with corrected version
3. ✓ Update any documentation referencing old field names
4. ✓ Archive original prompts with "deprecated" label

### Ongoing Prevention

**For Prompt Development:**
- Cross-check all field names against schema before finalizing
- Include schema version in prompt header
- Maintain prompt/schema version compatibility matrix
- Review prompts when schema updates

**For Extraction Process:**
- Always run Pass 3 validation
- Don't skip validation even if extraction "looks good"
- Treat validation failures as prompt/schema misalignment signals
- Update prompts based on validation feedback

**For Quality Control:**
- Periodic prompt audits against schema
- Field name consistency checks
- Test extractions with blank templates
- Validate test outputs before production use

## Schema v2.4 Reference (Correct Field Names)

**Method Object Cross-References:**
```json
{
  "method_id": "M001",
  "implements_designs": ["RD001", "RD002"],              // ✓ Correct
  "realized_through_protocols": ["P001", "P002"],        // ✓ Correct
  ...
}
```

**NOT:**
```json
{
  "method_id": "M001",
  "design_context": ["RD001", "RD002"],     // ✗ Wrong
  "uses_protocols": ["P001", "P002"],       // ✗ Wrong
  ...
}
```

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why did Pass 2 have fewer errors than Pass 1?**  
A: Pass 2 only references field names in validation instructions. Pass 1 had instructions, checklist, and workflow references.

**Q: Would Pass 2 have caught the error?**  
A: No - Pass 2 prompt said to check for `design_context`, so it would have validated the incorrect field names.

**Q: Is Pass 3 prompt correct?**  
A: Yes - Pass 3 validates against schema, which has correct field names. Pass 3 caught the error.

**Q: Should I re-run Pass 2 with corrected prompt?**  
A: Not necessary - your extraction is already corrected and validated. But use corrected prompts for future work.

**Q: Any other prompts need checking?**  
A: The Pass 3 validation prompt is already schema-based, so it was correct. Claims/Evidence prompts use different fields, but worth checking.
