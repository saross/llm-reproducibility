# Extraction Fundamentals - Universal Sourcing Requirements

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Schema Version:** 2.5+  
**Applies to:** All extraction passes (Pass 1, Pass 2)  
**Purpose:** Core sourcing requirements that apply across all object types

---

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY SOURCING REQUIREMENT

**Schema v2.5 introduced mandatory sourcing to prevent hallucination.**

Every extracted item must be traceable to specific passages in the paper. **No exceptions.**

### Universal Principle

**Before extracting ANY item, ask:**
- "Can I point to the exact text that states or implies this?"
- If NO â†’ **DO NOT EXTRACT**

---

## Explicit vs Implicit Content

All extractable content falls into two categories:

### EXPLICIT CONTENT
**Definition:** Directly stated in the paper with clear procedural detail or assertion.

**Required fields:**
- `verbatim_quote` (string, required) - Exact text from paper
- `location` (object, required) - Section, subsection, paragraph
- Content must match what quote actually says

**Quick test:** "Is this directly stated in the paper?"
- If YES â†’ Extract as explicit with verbatim_quote
- If NO â†’ Check if implicit (below)

**Examples of explicit content:**
- Evidence: "We recorded 8,343 features"
- Claims: "The mobile platform was more efficient"
- Methods: "We used stratified random sampling with 30% coverage"
- Protocols: "GPS coordinates recorded using Trimble GeoXH 6000"

---

### IMPLICIT CONTENT
**Definition:** Not directly stated but can be reasonably inferred from available passages.

**Required fields:**
- `trigger_text` (array of strings, required) - Verbatim passages that imply the content
- `trigger_locations` (array of location objects, required) - Where each trigger found
- `inference_reasoning` (string, required) - Explanation connecting triggers to inferred content
- `implicit_metadata` (object, required for some types) - Basis, gaps, confidence

**Quick test:** "Can I point to passages that together imply this?"
- If YES â†’ Extract as implicit with triggers
- If NO â†’ DO NOT EXTRACT

**Examples of implicit content:**
- Implicit Arguments: Unstated assumptions, logical implications
- Implicit Methods: Procedures mentioned but not described
- Implicit Protocols: Implementation details inferred from results

---

## Hallucination Prevention

**Critical rules:**

1. **No guessing** - If you cannot find source text, DO NOT extract the item
2. **No inferring from knowledge** - Only extract what paper actually says or clearly implies
3. **No combining unstated ideas** - Don't create synthetic claims from disparate observations
4. **Verbatim quotes required** - For explicit items, quote must be exact
5. **Trigger text required** - For implicit items, triggers must be verbatim passages

**Common hallucination risks:**
- Inferring methods that "must have been used" without textual support
- Creating claims that seem implied but have no trigger passages
- Assuming standard practices without paper mentioning them
- Over-interpreting vague statements

## Field Requirements Summary

### For ALL Explicit Items
```json
{
  "*_id": "string",
  "*_text": "string", 
  "*_status": "explicit",
  "verbatim_quote": "Exact text from paper (REQUIRED)",
  "location": {
    "section": "string (REQUIRED)",
    "subsection": "string or null",
    "paragraph": "integer or null"
  }
}
```

### For ALL Implicit Items
```json
{
  "*_id": "string",
  "*_text": "string",
  "*_status": "implicit",
  "trigger_text": [
    "Verbatim passage 1 that implies content",
    "Verbatim passage 2 that implies content"
  ],
  "trigger_locations": [
    {"section": "string", "subsection": "string", "paragraph": 1},
    {"section": "string", "subsection": "string", "paragraph": 3}
  ],
  "inference_reasoning": "Explanation of how triggers support inference (REQUIRED)",
  "location": {
    "section": "Primary location (REQUIRED)",
    "subsection": "string or null", 
    "paragraph": "integer or null"
  }
}
```

*Note: Some object types (RDMAP, Implicit Arguments) require additional `implicit_metadata` fields. See object-specific prompts for details.*

## Source Verification (Pass 3)

All extracted items are verified in Pass 3 using `source_verification` object:

### Explicit Items Verification
- `location_verified`: Stated location exists and discusses topic
- `quote_verified`: verbatim_quote found at stated location
- `content_aligned`: Item content matches what quote actually says

### Implicit Items Verification
- `trigger_locations_verified`: All trigger locations exist and accessible
- `trigger_quotes_verified`: All trigger_text found at stated locations  
- `inference_reasonable`: inference_reasoning is logical given triggers

**Quality threshold:** >95% pass rate expected across all items

## Quick Reference: Decision Tree

```
Can you point to text that states or implies this content?
â”œâ”€ NO â†’ DO NOT EXTRACT (item absent, not implicit)
â””â”€ YES â†’ Is it directly stated?
    â”œâ”€ YES â†’ EXPLICIT
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Extract verbatim_quote
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Set *_status = "explicit"
    â”‚   â””â”€ Record location
    â””â”€ NO, but implied â†’ IMPLICIT
        â”œâ”€ Extract trigger_text array (verbatim passages)
        â”œâ”€ Set *_status = "implicit"
        â”œâ”€ Record trigger_locations
        â”œâ”€ Explain inference_reasoning
        â””â”€ Complete implicit_metadata (if required)
```

## Remember

**Sourcing discipline is non-negotiable in schema v2.5.**

Every item must have:
- Explicit items: verbatim_quote pointing to source
- Implicit items: trigger_text array pointing to passages

**If you cannot source it, do not extract it.**

This requirement protects against hallucination and ensures all extractions are verifiable by checking against the source paper.
