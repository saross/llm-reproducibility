# Fieldwork Permits and CARE Principles Integration

**Purpose**: Reference guide for extracting and assessing fieldwork permits, authorisations, and ethical practices in HASS research

**Context**: Proper permitting demonstrates regulatory compliance, ethical practice, and respect for jurisdictions and communities

**Audience**: Research assessor skill users performing infrastructure extraction (Pass 6) or validation (Pass 7)

---

## Overview

Fieldwork research in archaeology, palaeoecology, geography, anthropology, and heritage science requires diverse permits and authorisations from government agencies, land managers, Traditional Owners, and communities.

**Why permits matter for reproducibility assessment:**
- **Transparency signal**: Proper permitting demonstrates procedural rigour and ethical practice
- **Validity signal**: Jurisdictional compliance supports methodological legitimacy
- **Ethics signal**: CARE principles integration increasingly expected (UNESCO 2021, US federal guidance 2022)
- **Reproducibility context**: Understanding legal/ethical constraints explains data access restrictions

**Assessment approach**: Presence and documentation of appropriate permits indicates responsible research practice

## CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

**Context**: The CARE Principles (Carroll et al. 2020) complement FAIR principles by addressing power imbalances in data practices and centring Indigenous rights and interests.

**Relationship to FAIR**: CARE principles prioritise **people and purpose**, while FAIR principles prioritise **data and systems**. Both are necessary for ethical, responsible research.

---

### The Four CARE Principles

#### C: Collective Benefit

**Principle**: Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.

**Implications for research:**
- Research designed with community input (co-design)
- Data use benefits communities (not just researchers)
- Results shared back to communities in accessible formats
- Knowledge translation and capacity building

**Observable in papers:**
- Community co-authorship
- Acknowledgement of community research priorities
- Benefits to communities described
- Knowledge sharing activities mentioned

**Example**: "Research priorities identified through consultation with community Elders. Results presented to community in public forum prior to publication."

---

#### A: Authority to Control

**Principle**: Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised, and their authority to control such data must be respected.

**Implications for research:**
- Community consent required for research on traditional lands
- Community veto power over publication (sometimes)
- Intellectual property rights respected
- Data sovereignty acknowledged

**Observable in papers:**
- Community research agreements documented
- Permission statements in acknowledgements
- Restricted data access with community justification
- Co-governance arrangements described

**Example**: "Fieldwork conducted with permission from Gunditjmara Traditional Owners under research agreement. Site location data restricted to protect cultural heritage sites; available to researchers via application to Traditional Owners."

**FAIR integration**: Restricted data access with CARE justification = **POSITIVE FAIR A1.2 signal**

---

#### R: Responsibility

**Principle**: Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how data are used to support Indigenous Peoples' self-determination and collective benefit.

**Implications for research:**
- Transparent reporting of data use
- Respectful relationships with communities
- Long-term commitments (not just extractive research)
- Accountability to communities

**Observable in papers:**
- Long-term collaborations described
- Community relationships acknowledged
- Ongoing engagement plans mentioned
- Respectful terminology used

**Example**: "Research conducted as part of ongoing 10-year collaboration with [Community]. Results inform community land management plans."

---

#### E: Ethics

**Principle**: Indigenous Peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle.

**Implications for research:**
- Indigenous ethical frameworks applied (not just institutional IRB)
- Cultural protocols respected
- Risks to communities minimised (reputational, privacy, cultural harm)
- Indigenous knowledge systems valued

**Observable in papers:**
- Dual ethics approvals (institutional + community)
- Cultural protocols acknowledged
- Indigenous methodologies employed
- Indigenous knowledge credited

**Example**: "Research approved by University Human Research Ethics Committee and conducted under cultural protocols agreed with community Elders."

---

## CARE-Permit Integration

**How CARE principles connect to permit documentation:**

### Land Access Agreements = Authority to Control

Traditional Owner land access agreements operationalise the Authority to Control principle by:
- Recognising Indigenous jurisdiction over lands and waters
- Requiring explicit community permission for research activities
- Giving communities decision-making power over research on their lands

**Assessment indicator**: Documented land access agreements with Traditional Owner groups = exemplary CARE compliance

---

### Community Research Agreements = Collective Benefit + Ethics

Formal research agreements often include:
- Community priorities shaping research questions
- Benefit-sharing arrangements (employment, capacity building, knowledge products)
- Cultural protocols and ethical frameworks
- Data governance and intellectual property clauses

**Assessment indicator**: Community research agreement with benefit-sharing = exemplary CARE compliance

---

### Permit Documentation = Responsibility

Transparent reporting of permits and agreements demonstrates:
- Accountability to jurisdictions and communities
- Procedural legitimacy
- Respect for regulatory frameworks
- Ethical research conduct

**Assessment indicator**: Comprehensive permit documentation = transparency signal

---

### Ethical Restrictions on Data = POSITIVE FAIR+CARE Signal

Restricted access to data with ethical justification demonstrates:
- Respect for community data sovereignty (CARE Authority to Control)
- Protection of sensitive cultural/ecological information
- Compliance with FAIR A1.2 (authentication/authorisation where necessary)
- Ethical research practice

**Assessment approach**:
- ✅ **Exemplary**: Restricted access + clear ethical justification + community agreement + pathway for appropriate access
- ❌ **Problematic**: Fully open data without community consultation (if culturally sensitive)
- ❌ **Problematic**: Restricted access with no justification (gatekeeping)

---

## Extraction and Assessment Guidance

### When Extracting Permits (Pass 6):

1. **Scan Acknowledgements section first** - Most permits mentioned here
2. **Check Methods section** - Especially "Study Site" or "Field Methods" subsections
3. **Look for ethics statements** - Often combined with permit information
4. **Extract verbatim text** - Capture exact permit language
5. **Classify permit type** - Use 10 types listed above
6. **Record details**: Issuing authority, permit number, jurisdiction, dates
7. **Note CARE integration** - Community agreements, Traditional Owner permissions

### Assessment Indicators:

**Exemplary practice** (high transparency + ethics):
- Multiple appropriate permits documented
- Community research agreements present
- CARE principles integration evident
- Restricted data access with ethical justification

**Good practice**:
- Appropriate permits documented
- Clear jurisdictional compliance

**Unclear**:
- Permits mentioned but details vague
- Unclear whether all necessary permits obtained

**Concerning**:
- No permit documentation for activities requiring permits
- Research on Indigenous lands without community permission mentioned

- Ethical research conduct
- Respect for Indigenous data sovereignty
- Long-term community relationships (not extractive research)

### Transparency Signal

Detailed permit documentation demonstrates:
- Openness about research conditions and constraints
- Accountability to multiple stakeholders
- Confidence in research legitimacy

### Reproducibility Context

Permit information explains:
- Why certain data may be restricted (ethical/legal requirements)
- What permissions future researchers would need
- What jurisdictional relationships enable research
