# The Seven repliCATS Credibility Signals: HASS-Adapted Definitions

**Purpose:** Define credibility assessment signals for HASS research with approach-specific scoring anchors

**Date:** 2025-11-17

**Version:** 2.0 (with approach-specific anchors)

---

## Overview

The repliCATS project (Collaborative Assessment for Trustworthy Science) developed a structured framework for assessing research credibility through seven distinct signals. These signals are adapted here for Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) research, with concrete scoring anchors that vary by research approach (deductive/inductive/abductive).

**Key Innovation:** Different research approaches require different credibility criteria. A score of 75 on Transparency means different things for deductive research (data + code sharing) versus inductive research (workflow transparency). Use approach-specific anchors to avoid false equivalence.

## Signal 1: Comprehensibility (Clarity of Claims & Argument)

### Definition

Are claims clear, explicit, and well-structured? Can readers understand what is being claimed and on what basis?

### HASS-Specific Considerations

- Are central claims **explicit** and **bounded** (not vague or unlimited)?
- Are key domain terms defined? (e.g., "site," "landscape unit," "phase")
- Is the logical structure of the argument traceable?
- Can claims be evaluated independently?

### Assessment Questions

- Are claims stated explicitly or left implicit?
- Are scope boundaries clear (who/what/where/when)?
- Are technical terms defined in context?
- Can the logical structure be traced from evidence to claim?

### Red Flags and Green Flags

**Red Flags:**

- Vague, unbounded claims ("the landscape was intensively used")
- Undefined technical terminology
- Implicit assumptions not stated
- Logical leaps without explanation

**Green Flags:**

- Explicit, bounded claims with clear scope ("Between 1200-900 BCE, settlements in the Vardar valley concentrated within 2km of the river")
- Key terms defined
- Transparent reasoning structure
- Claims traceable to evidence

## Signal 6: Replicability (Analytic Reproducibility)

### Definition

Can others reproduce the **analytical outputs** given the same inputs? (Note: For HASS, this means analytic reproducibility, NOT field replication of non-repeatable phenomena)

**Critical adaptation for HASS:** Replicability = Analytic Reproducibility, NOT field replication

- Can others reproduce the **analytical outputs** given the same inputs?
- Are data and code available and complete?
- Are computational workflows documented?
- Can analytical steps be traced and rerun?

**Important:** This does NOT mean "can you re-excavate the site" (impossible) — it means "given the excavation data, can you reproduce the analysis?"

### Assessment Questions

- Are raw data publicly accessible (or appropriately restricted with justification)?
- Is analysis code available and documented?
- Can analytical workflows be traced step-by-step?
- Are data and code complete (not just fragments)?

- Persistent identifiers (DOIs)
- FAIR/CARE compliance where appropriate

## Using Approach-Specific Anchors

### Scoring Procedure

1. **Identify research approach** from classification.json (deductive/inductive/abductive)
2. **Select appropriate anchor set** for that approach
3. **Assess paper against anchor descriptions** (not universal criteria)
4. **Assign score within appropriate band** (0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, 80-100)
5. **Justify score by referencing specific anchor criteria** met or missed

### Example Justification Template

> "[Signal Name] scored [X] ([Band Description] for [approach] research). This paper [meets criteria A, B, C required for band], but [lacks criterion D which would move to higher band]. [Approach-specific note explaining why certain criteria apply or don't apply]."

**Example:**

> "Transparency scored 75 (Good Transparency band for inductive research). This paper clearly documents exploratory goals and data collection procedures (required for 60-79), has archived data (60-79), but lacks detailed analysis workflow documentation (would move to 80-100). Pre-registration not expected for inductive work, so absence does not lower score."

### Critical Note: Cross-Approach Comparison

**A score of 75 means different things for different approaches:**

- 75 for deductive research implies data + code sharing, hypothesis specification
- 75 for inductive research implies workflow transparency, sampling documentation
- 75 for abductive research implies framework clarity, alternative explanations

**Do not compare scores across approaches numerically.** Instead, compare against anchor descriptions. The anchors define what constitutes "good" or "excellent" work within each research tradition.
