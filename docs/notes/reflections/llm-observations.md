# LLM Observations

Frank, honest observations from each session. This is Claude's document —
the user will not edit it.

## Guidelines

- Observations about the session, the collaboration, the research, or the methodology
- Criticisms of the approach, the user's contributions, the codebase, or project
  direction — paired with constructive suggestions
- Positive and neutral observations are equally welcome
- No diplomatic hedging — genuine reflection, not performance
