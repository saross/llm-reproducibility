# Session Reflection Investigation

Structured reflection entries following the six-prompt protocol.

## Format

Each entry should be numbered sequentially and include:

1. **What struck you?** — The most salient observation from this session.
2. **What would a future instance need to know?** — Practical knowledge for continuity.
3. **What surprised you?** — Expectations violated or confirmed unexpectedly.
4. **What was the texture?** — The qualitative feel of the session's workflow.
5. **What questions weren't pursued?** — Threads left unexplored.
6. **What do you notice now that you didn't articulate?** — Post-hoc observations only
   visible in retrospect. This prompt is likely the most important.

After the six prompts, include:

- **Meta-Reflection**: Update the Entry/Session/Theme table. Note which prompts were
  most productive for this session type and any patterns across entries.
- **Summary block**: Session date, reported texture, key observation, noted preferences,
  engagement level, unsolicited generation, relational note.
