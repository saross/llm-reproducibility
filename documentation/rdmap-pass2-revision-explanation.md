## Impact Analysis

### What This Achieves

**1. Faster Processing** ‚ö°
- 39% fewer lines = significantly faster to load
- Reduced token consumption per rationalization
- Clearer structure for faster comprehension

**2. Progressive Disclosure** üìñ
- Essential patterns in prompt
- Detailed guidance in skill files
- Cross-references make architecture visible

**3. Reduced Redundancy** ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Eliminated 80-line quality checks section (100% redundant with checklist)
- Condensed verification tasks (57% reduction)
- No duplication with skill components

**4. Maintained Completeness** ‚úÖ
- All 6 RDMAP consolidation patterns preserved
- All verification tasks intact
- All critical decision guidance maintained

### What This Doesn't Change

**Consolidation quality:** All patterns and principles preserved  
**Verification rigor:** All checks maintained  
**Cross-referencing:** Complete bidirectional validation  
**Information preservation:** All requirements intact

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removing redundant quality checks section (pure duplication)
- ‚úÖ Condensing RDMAP patterns (principles preserved, examples simplified)
- ‚úÖ Streamlining verification tasks (all checks maintained)
- ‚úÖ Cross-referencing to skill files (content still accessible)

**Medium Risk Changes:**

**No High Risk Changes**

---

## Testing Recommendations

**Test 1: RDMAP Consolidation Patterns**
- Run on Methods section with scattered workflow steps
- Verify workflow_integration pattern applied correctly
- Check validation_chain consolidation for QC procedures

**Test 2: Tier Assignment Correction**
- Run on section with mixed tier classifications from Pass 1
- Verify items moved to correct tiers
- Check cross-references updated appropriately

**Test 3: Cross-Reference Validation**
- Run on complete RDMAP extraction
- Verify bidirectional consistency maintained
- Check design ‚Üí method ‚Üí protocol chains intact

**Test 4: Boundary Accuracy**
- Run on section with mixed description + argumentation
- Verify RDMAP vs claims boundary enforced
- Check claims properly separated to claims array

**Test 5: Information Preservation**
- Run on protocol-heavy section
- Verify quantitative values preserved through consolidation
- Check consolidation_metadata documents any losses

---

## Key Insight

**From comprehensive rationalization manual to focused consolidation guide**

**Before:** Self-contained document with extensive verification procedures  
**After:** Focused consolidation guide with clear patterns and verification checklist

The 39% reduction comes from:
1. **Eliminating pure redundancy** (quality checks section)
2. **Condensing patterns** (preserving principles, removing verbose examples)
3. **Cross-referencing** (tier guidance, expected information)
4. **Streamlining examples** (key fields only)

All **decision-making capability preserved**, all **verification tasks maintained**, but **execution path clarified**.

## Comparison to Claims Pass 2

**Claims Pass 2:**
- Original: 314 lines ‚Üí Revised: 319 lines (+2%)
- Minimal change (already lean)

**RDMAP Pass 2:**
- Original: 741 lines ‚Üí Revised: 454 lines (-39%)
- Major streamlining (was bloated)

**Why the difference?**
- RDMAP Pass 2 had extensive redundancy (quality checks duplicated checklist)
- RDMAP Pass 2 had verbose pattern examples (condensable)
- Claims Pass 2 was already optimized

---

## Conclusion

The revised RDMAP Pass 2 prompt maintains all essential rationalization guidance while:
- Reducing length by 39% (741 ‚Üí 454 lines)
- Eliminating redundancy (quality checks section removed)
- Preserving all 6 RDMAP consolidation patterns
- Maintaining all verification tasks
- Implementing progressive disclosure

**Ready for:** Integration into skill and testing on Sobotkova Methods section.

## Next Steps

With 3 of 5 prompts revised, remaining:
1. **Validation Pass 3** - Final prompt to revise
2. **Testing** - Validate workflow on Sobotkova Methods

The streamlining approach is now well-established and can be confidently applied to the final prompt.
