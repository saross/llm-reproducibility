## Revision Approach

### Core Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**
   - Prompts become focused workflow guides
   - Detailed reference material moved to skill checklist files
   - Cross-references added at key decision points

2. **Redundancy Elimination**
   - Removed content duplicated in skill files (tier assignment, consolidation patterns, expected information checklists)
   - Preserved only workflow-essential guidance in prompts
   - Maintained all decision-making logic

3. **Structural Optimization**
   - Quality checklists moved to top of each prompt
   - Section headers simplified and consolidated
   - Examples condensed while preserving key patterns

4. **Strategic Cross-Referencing**
   - Added cross-references at moments of uncertainty
   - Linked to authoritative skill resources
   - Enabled deeper learning without bloating prompts

### What Was NEVER Changed

- ✅ All decision-making frameworks and logic
- ✅ All validation rules and checks
- ✅ All boundary distinctions and tests
- ✅ All consolidation patterns
- ✅ All reasoning approach classifications
- ✅ Iterative workflow architecture (5-pass system)
- ✅ JSON schema structure and cross-reference formats

## Architectural Improvements

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Implementation

**Before:** Everything in prompts (3,394 lines total)

**After:** 
- Core workflow in prompts (2,313 lines)
- Detailed frameworks in reference files
- Cross-references at decision points

**Impact:**
- Reduced cognitive load during extraction
- Maintained access to deep knowledge when needed
- Enabled skill architecture to function as intended

### 2. Quality Checklist Standardization

**Pattern Applied Across All 5 Prompts:**

```
## Quality Checklist for Pass [1/2/3]

[Comprehensive checklist at top]
- Visible immediately
- Used as validation reference
- Eliminates need for redundant "Quality Checks" sections later
```

**Result:** Consistent structure across all prompts, eliminated redundant end-of-prompt checklists

### 3. Strategic Cross-Referencing

**15 Total Cross-References Added:**

| Prompt | Cross-References | To Files |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Claims Pass 1 | 3 | tier-assignment-guide.md, expected-information.md, schema-guide.md |
| Claims Pass 2 | 3 | consolidation-patterns.md, expected-information.md, schema-guide.md |
| RDMAP Pass 1 | 3 | tier-assignment-guide.md, expected-information.md, schema-guide.md |
| RDMAP Pass 2 | 3 | consolidation-patterns.md, tier-assignment-guide.md, expected-information.md |
| Validation Pass 3 | 3 | schema-guide.md, expected-information.md, consolidation-patterns.md |

**Placement Strategy:** Cross-references added at moments of uncertainty or decision complexity, not scattered randomly.

### 4. Redundancy Elimination Patterns

**Identified and Removed:**

1. **Duplicated Checklists:** 80-line quality checks in RDMAP Pass 2 that duplicated the checklist
2. **Replicated Content:** Expected information checklists appearing in both prompts and reference files
3. **Verbose Explanations:** Extended descriptions where concise specifications sufficed
4. **Repeated Examples:** Similar patterns shown multiple times
5. **Version Tags:** Development artifacts like "(NEW v2.3)"

**Never Removed:**

- Decision-making logic
- Validation rules
- Boundary tests
- Core principles
- Essential examples

## Impact Assessment

### Token Economy

**Estimated Token Impact:**

| Context | Before | After | Savings |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Single prompt invocation | 900-1,500 | 500-750 | **~40-50%** |
| Complete 5-pass extraction | 5,500+ | 3,500+ | **~35-40%** |
| With reference file access | Variable | +500-1000 | Conditional |

**Key Insight:** Reference files only loaded when needed, so most extractions use only revised prompt tokens.

### Cognitive Load Reduction

**For Users:**
- Prompts now focused on workflow steps
- Less information overload
- Clear pointers to deeper resources
- Quality checklists immediately visible

**For Claude:**
- More focused task context
- Clear decision frameworks
- Access to deep knowledge when needed
- Better structured validation

### Maintainability Improvement

**Single Source of Truth:**
- Expected information checklists: ONE file
- Consolidation patterns: ONE file  
- Tier assignment rules: ONE file
- Schema definitions: ONE file

**Update Impact:**
- Change checklist once → applies to all prompts via cross-reference
- No need to sync redundant content across files
- Easier to identify and fix inconsistencies

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Redundancy Identification**
   - Comparing prompts against skill files revealed extensive duplication
   - Expected information checklists were biggest redundancy (125+ lines per prompt)

2. **Conservative Consolidation Approach**
   - Preserved all decision logic
   - Removed only content available in reference files
   - Added cross-references at appropriate points

3. **Quality Checklist Repositioning**
   - Moving checklists to top improved usability
   - Enabled removal of redundant end-of-prompt quality checks

4. **Selective Example Reduction**
   - Condensed examples without losing patterns
   - Focused on key fields rather than complete JSON

### What Required Careful Attention

1. **Cross-Reference Placement**
   - Had to identify genuine moments of uncertainty
   - Avoided over-referencing (would be annoying)
   - Placed at decision points, not scattered randomly

2. **Example Preservation**
   - Needed enough examples to show patterns
   - But not so many that prompts became unwieldy
   - Found balance at 4-6 examples per prompt

3. **Validation Prompt Compression**
   - Inherently less compressible (procedural checks)
   - 16% reduction appropriate vs 39-43% for extraction prompts
   - Maintained all validation logic

### Surprises

1. **Claims Pass 2 Optimization**
   - Already well-optimized at v2.3
   - Only 2% change (structural, not content)
   - Demonstrated that some prompts don't need major revision

2. **Quality Checks Duplication**
   - 80-line section in RDMAP Pass 2 was 100% redundant
   - Complete duplicate of checklist
   - Easy win once identified

3. **Expected Information Impact**
   - Removing these checklists had biggest impact
   - 125+ lines per prompt
   - Perfect content for reference files (domain-specific, comprehensive, stable)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Further Optimizations

1. **Example Library**
   - Could move all examples to separate file
   - Prompts reference example IDs
   - Trade-off: Examples inline are immediately useful

2. **Domain-Specific Variants**
   - Could create archaeology-specific vs ecology-specific prompts
   - More targeted guidance
   - Trade-off: Maintenance complexity

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Could add prompt-chaining guidance
   - Automated validation after Pass 2
   - Trade-off: Reduces flexibility

### Monitoring & Iteration

**Recommended:**
1. Test on 10-20 papers
2. Track where Claude references skill files
3. Identify underused cross-references (remove)
4. Identify missing cross-references (add)
5. Adjust examples based on confusion patterns

---

## Conclusion

Successfully revised all five prompts to work optimally within the research-assessor skill's progressive disclosure architecture. Achieved significant compression (32% overall) while preserving complete decision-making capability.

**Key Achievement:** Transformed prompts from standalone documents into focused workflow guides that leverage skill resources appropriately.

**Ready For:** Integration into skill package, testing on Sobotkova Methods section, and deployment.

**Maintenance Note:** Future updates to consolidation patterns, tier assignment rules, or expected information checklists only need to be made once in reference files - prompts will automatically reference updated versions.
