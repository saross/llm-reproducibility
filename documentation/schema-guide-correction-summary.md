## Impact

**Before correction:**
- ❌ Extractors would use wrong field names
- ❌ JSON validation would fail
- ❌ Cross-references would break
- ❌ Required fields incorrect

**After correction:**
- ✅ All field names match schema
- ✅ JSON validates correctly
- ✅ Cross-references work properly
- ✅ Required fields accurate

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Schema guide corrected
2. ⏭️ Re-package skill with corrected guide
3. ⏭️ Test extraction with sample to verify field names work
4. ⏭️ Proceed with revising remaining 4 prompts

**Before production:**
1. Validate complete extraction against extraction_schema.json
2. Verify all cross-references resolve correctly
3. Test on Sobotkova paper with corrected schema
