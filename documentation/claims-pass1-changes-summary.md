# Claims/Evidence Pass 1 v2.4 - Option A Changes Summary

**Approach:** Minimal intervention - add strategic cross-references only  
**Lines added:** 3 cross-references  
**Lines removed:** 0  
**Total change:** +3 lines (2% increase)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. After "Evidence vs. Claims Distinction" (Line 72)

**Added:**
```
→ For detailed decision framework, see `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md`
```

**Rationale:** 
- Most common decision point during extraction
- tier-assignment-guide.md has comprehensive tests for boundaries
- Makes skill resource visible at moment of uncertainty

---

### 2. After "Expected Information Checklists" (Line 155)

**Added:**
```
→ For comprehensive checklists by domain, see `references/checklists/expected-information.md`
```

**Rationale:**
- Prompt shows brief checklist examples
- expected-information.md has domain-specific comprehensive versions
- Progressive disclosure - use this for quick reference, go deeper if needed

---

### 3. After "Output Format" (Line 238)

**Added:**
```
→ For complete object structure and field definitions, see `references/schema/schema-guide.md`
```

**Rationale:**
- Output format shows structure, not field definitions
- schema-guide.md has complete field documentation
- Reduces need to duplicate schema info in prompt

## What Was NOT Changed

- All extraction principles (unchanged)
- Philosophy section (unchanged)
- Workflow steps (unchanged)
- Quality checklist (unchanged)
- Structure and organization (unchanged)
- All examples and guidance (unchanged)

## Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** Very low
- No content removed
- No structural changes
- Only additions are pointers to existing resources
- If Claude doesn't use references, execution identical to original

**Expected Benefit:**
- Makes skill architecture visible
- Provides path to deeper resources when uncertain
- Demonstrates progressive disclosure principle
- Sets pattern for other 4 prompts

**Token Impact:**
- Original: 147 lines
- Revised: 150 lines
- Net increase: 2%
- Negligible token cost for skill invocation

## Testing Recommendation

Test on known section (e.g., Sobotkova Methods) and check:
1. Does extraction quality match original prompt?
2. When uncertain, does Claude reference the guides?
3. Are the cross-references helpful or ignored?

If quality matches and references are used appropriately → apply same approach to other 4 prompts.

## Next Steps

1. Review revised prompt
2. PAUSED - Awaiting your other prompt versions
3. Apply similar approach to Claims Pass 2, RDMAP 1/2/3
4. Test complete skill with revised prompts
