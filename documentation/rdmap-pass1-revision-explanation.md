## Major Changes

### 1. Quality Checklist Added to Top ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
**Before:** No checklist at top  
**After:** 11-item checklist immediately after "Your Task" (lines 39-51)

**Why:** Roadmap principle - see goals before diving into details

**Effect:** +13 lines, but improves usability

---

### 2. Core Extraction Principles HEAVILY Streamlined ‚úÇÔ∏è

**Removed sections (now in skill checklists):**

**a) Extended Tier Hierarchy Explanation** (-70 lines)
- **Before:** Full explanations of Design/Method/Protocol with multiple examples
- **After:** Quick decision tree + brief definitions
- **Rationale:** Detailed guidance in `tier-assignment-guide.md`
- **Cross-reference added:** Line 135

**b) Expected Information Checklists** (-125 lines)
- **Before:** Lines 240-310 had 4 complete checklists:
  - TIDieR-adapted method documentation (10 items)
  - CONSORT-adapted measurement specs (8 items)  
  - Sampling strategy checklist (7 items)
  - Analysis methods checklist (7 items)
- **After:** Brief explanation + cross-reference
- **Rationale:** All checklists already in `expected-information.md`
- **Cross-reference added:** Line 213

**c) Controlled Vocabularies** (-50 lines)
- **Before:** Lines 312-361 had extensive vocabulary lists:
  - Reasoning approaches (5 options)
  - Study designs (8+ options)
  - Sampling types (13+ options)
  - Analysis populations (4 options)
- **After:** Removed entirely (standard vocabularies don't need to be in extraction prompt)
- **Rationale:** Extractors can use natural language; no need for vocab reference here

**d) Extended Cross-Reference Patterns** (-30 lines)
- **Before:** Detailed explanation of every cross-reference type with examples
- **After:** Concise bullet list (lines 241-248)
- **Rationale:** Cross-referencing is straightforward once you understand the objects

**e) Location Tracking Details** (-20 lines)
- **Before:** Extended explanation of location tracking
- **After:** Brief mention in workflow, explicit in examples
- **Rationale:** Self-explanatory in schema

**f) Fieldwork-Specific Guidance** (-35 lines)
- **Before:** Lines 365-465 had extended discussion of:
  - Opportunistic decisions (21 lines)
  - Contingency plans (14 lines)
  - Emergent discoveries (18 lines)
- **After:** Condensed to essential points (lines 215-229)
- **Rationale:** Key concepts preserved, extended examples removed

---

### 3. Examples Dramatically Condensed ‚úÇÔ∏è

**Before:** 6 examples √ó ~40-45 lines each = ~255 lines
- Full JSON objects shown
- Every field populated
- Extensive extraction_notes
- Multiple examples per category

**After:** 4 examples √ó ~30 lines each = ~120 lines
- Key fields only (not full objects)
- Focus on decision points
- Concise extraction_notes
- One example per key pattern

**Examples removed:**
- Example 5: Protocol - Tool Specification (redundant with Example 3)
- Example 6: Protocol - Measurement with Decision Rules (redundant)

**Examples condensed:**
- All remaining examples shortened by ~30%
- Focus on what makes each decision challenging
- Remove obvious field population

**Reduction:** ~135 lines (-53%)

---

### 4. Cross-References Added üîó

Added 3 explicit cross-references:

1. **Line 135:** ‚Üí `tier-assignment-guide.md` (after tier hierarchy)
2. **Line 213:** ‚Üí `expected-information.md` (after missing elements discussion)
3. **Line 485:** ‚Üí `schema-guide.md` (after output format)

**Progressive disclosure:** Claude loads detailed guidance only when needed

---

**Section consolidation:**
- "Description vs Argumentation Boundary" moved up (now section 2)
- "Reasoning Approach" and "Research Questions vs Hypotheses" consolidated (sections 3-4)

## Impact Analysis

### What This Achieves

**1. Faster Loading** ‚ö°
- 43% fewer lines = faster for Claude to load and process
- Reduced token consumption per extraction

**2. Progressive Disclosure** üìñ
- Essential guidance in prompt
- Detailed checklists available when needed
- Cross-references make skill architecture visible

**3. Reduced Redundancy** ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Single source of truth for checklists
- No duplication between prompt and skill files
- Easier to maintain consistency

**4. Maintained Quality** ‚úÖ
- All critical decision frameworks preserved
- All boundary cases covered
- All extraction philosophy intact

### What This Doesn't Change

**Quality of extractions:** All decision guidance present
**Comprehensiveness:** Still captures all RDMAP
**Uncertainty handling:** Still liberal extraction philosophy
**Cross-referencing:** Still complete bidirectional links

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removing controlled vocabularies (not needed in prompt)
- ‚úÖ Condensing examples (key points preserved)
- ‚úÖ Cross-referencing checklists (all content still accessible)
- ‚úÖ Streamlining tier hierarchy (decision tree preserved)

**Medium Risk Changes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Removing extended fieldwork guidance (condensed to essentials)
  - **Mitigation:** Key concepts (opportunistic, contingent, emergent) preserved
  - **Test:** Verify Claude still identifies these patterns in text

**No High Risk Changes**

---

## Testing Recommendations

**Test 1: Tier Assignment**
- Run on Methods section with mixed design/method/protocol content
- Verify Claude uses decision tree correctly
- Check if tier-assignment-guide.md is consulted when uncertain

**Test 2: Expected Information Flagging**
- Run on section with incomplete methodology
- Verify `expected_information_missing` arrays populated
- Check if expected-information.md is referenced

**Test 3: Reasoning Approach Classification**
- Run on section with explicit reasoning statements
- Verify classification (inductive/deductive/abductive/mixed/unclear)
- Check confidence levels and indicators

**Test 4: Fieldwork Patterns**
- Run on section with opportunistic decisions
- Verify Claude identifies and marks opportunistic/contingent/emergent
- Check extraction_notes document these patterns

**Test 5: Cross-Referencing**
- Run complete extraction (designs ‚Üí methods ‚Üí protocols)
- Verify bidirectional links (enables_methods ‚Üî design_context)
- Check claim ‚Üí method cross-references

---

## Key Insight

**From comprehensive instruction manual to focused decision guide**

**Before:** Self-contained document teaching everything about RDMAP extraction  
**After:** Focused workflow guide that references skill components when needed

This implements **progressive disclosure** - Claude has everything it needs to start extracting, with clear paths to deeper guidance when uncertainty arises.

The 43% reduction comes from **eliminating teaching** (now in skill) while **preserving decision-making** (stays in prompt).

---

## Conclusion

The revised RDMAP Pass 1 prompt maintains all essential extraction guidance while:
- Reducing length by 43% (878 ‚Üí 499 lines)
- Eliminating redundancy with skill checklists
- Implementing progressive disclosure
- Preserving all critical decision frameworks
- Maintaining all boundary case guidance

**Ready for:** Integration into skill and testing on Sobotkova Methods section.

## Recommendation

Before proceeding to RDMAP Pass 2, consider testing this revision to ensure:
1. Tier assignments remain accurate
2. Expected information flagging works correctly
3. Cross-references to skill files are followed appropriately
4. No critical guidance was inadvertently removed

This will validate the approach before applying similar streamlining to RDMAP Pass 2.
