# Schema v2.5 Change Tracking - Update Summary

## Updates Complete ✓

The change tracking document has been finalized with your suggestion to use `trigger_text` for implicit methods, creating full consistency with implicit arguments.

---

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Unified Field Structure for All Implicit Content** ✓

**Implicit Arguments AND Implicit Methods/Protocols/Designs now use identical structure:**

```json
{
  "trigger_text": ["passage 1", "passage 2", ...],           // Array of verbatim passages
  "trigger_locations": [                                      // Parallel array of locations
    {"section": "X", "subsection": "Y", "paragraph": Z},
    {...}
  ],
  "inference_reasoning": "Explanation..."                     // How triggers support content
}
```

**Replaced old structure:**
```json
{
  "mentioned_text": "single passage",        // ❌ Only one passage
  "mention_location": ["location"],          // ❌ Different name
  "inference_basis": "explanation"           // ❌ Different name
}
```

---

### 2. **Schema Changes Updated** ✓

All three RDMAP entity types now have consistent implicit_metadata:

**Research Design Object:**
- `trigger_text`: array of strings (verbatim passages)
- `trigger_locations`: array of location objects
- `inference_reasoning`: string
- Plus: `basis`, `transparency_gap`, `assessability_impact`, `reconstruction_confidence`
- **Required:** basis, trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning, transparency_gap, assessability_impact

**Method Object:**
- Identical structure to research designs

**Protocol Object:**
- Identical structure to research designs

---

### 3. **Added Consistency Explanation** ✓

New section in Issue #1: **"Consistency with Implicit Arguments"**

Includes:
- **Comparison table** showing field structure
- **Why this matters** (4 key reasons)
- **Verification consistency** - same 3-part procedure applies to both
- **Multiple mentions example** - P002 can capture passages from Discussion, Introduction, Methods
- **Worked example** - Complete P002 protocol with trigger_text array
- **Conceptual parallel** - Both track unstated content inferred from stated passages

---

### 4. **Verification Procedures Apply to Both Types** ✓

Issue #3 verification procedures now explicitly cover:
- Evidence/Claims (explicit content) → `verbatim_quote` verification
- Implicit Arguments (implicit claims) → `trigger_text` verification  
- Implicit Methods (implicit documentation) → `trigger_text` verification (same as arguments)

**Same 3-part verification for all implicit content:**
1. Trigger location verification - Do all locations exist?
2. Trigger quote verification - Is each trigger_text found?
3. Inference reasonableness - Do triggers support the inference?

---

### 5. **Implementation Checklist Updated** ✓

Phase 5 (Issue #1 Schema Changes):
- Updated to use `trigger_text`, `trigger_locations`, `inference_reasoning`
- Required fields list corrected

Phase 6 (Issue #1 Prompts):
- Guidance to populate trigger_text for implicit methods (parallel to implicit arguments)

Phase 7 (Issue #1 Skills):
- Document trigger_text parallel with implicit arguments

Phase 8 (Issue #1 Testing):
- Verify trigger_text, trigger_locations, inference_reasoning captured correctly

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Verification Consistency**
- One set of detailed verification procedures in skill works for BOTH types
- Prompts can reference same verification pattern
- Reduces complexity in both prompts and skill

### 2. **Handles Multiple Mentions**
- Protocol P002 might be mentioned in Discussion, Introduction, Methods
- Old structure: could only capture ONE mention
- New structure: captures ALL mentions in array
- Better transparency about what text supports reconstruction

### 3. **Conceptual Clarity**
Both implicit types track same pattern:
- Extractors found stated passages (trigger_text)
- Those passages imply/support something NOT explicitly stated
- Inference_reasoning explains the connection

### 4. **Easier to Document**
- One pattern to explain instead of two
- Skill documentation can cover both together
- Examples show same structure for both types

### 5. **Easier to Extract**
- Same mental model for both types
- "Find trigger passages, record locations, explain reasoning"
- Works whether reconstructing implicit argument or implicit method

## Example Comparison

**OLD APPROACH (mentioned_text):**
```json
{
  "protocol_status": "implicit",
  "implicit_metadata": {
    "mentioned_text": "2010 used supervised desktop GIS",     // ❌ Only one passage
    "mention_location": ["4.1.1"],                             // ❌ Vague location
    "inference_basis": "Mentioned in Discussion"               // ❌ Weak explanation
  }
}
```

**NEW APPROACH (trigger_text):**
```json
{
  "protocol_status": "implicit",
  "implicit_metadata": {
    "trigger_text": [                                          // ✓ Multiple passages
      "The 2010 TRAP digitization took place using traditional desktop GIS methods with experienced staff supervision",
      "In contrast to the 2010 supervised approach, the 2017 crowdsourcing method eliminated direct supervision"
    ],
    "trigger_locations": [                                     // ✓ Precise locations
      {"section": "4.1.1", "subsection": "Historical Comparison", "paragraph": 2},
      {"section": "4.1.1", "subsection": "Historical Comparison", "paragraph": 3}
    ],
    "inference_reasoning": "Two passages in Discussion describe 2010 method as 'supervised desktop GIS' contrasting with 2017 crowdsourcing. From these mentions we reconstruct the protocol, though procedural details absent from Methods section."  // ✓ Clear explanation
  }
}
```

## Semantic Consistency Achieved

**"Implicit" now has consistent meaning across all entity types:**

| Entity | "Explicit" Means | "Implicit" Means | Sourcing Field |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Evidence** | Paper states finding | N/A - always explicit | `verbatim_quote` |
| **Claim** | Author states claim | We infer from passages | `verbatim_quote` (explicit) or `trigger_text` (implicit) |
| **Method** | Documented in Methods | Not documented | `verbatim_quote` (explicit) or `trigger_text` (implicit) |
| **Protocol** | Documented in Methods | Not documented | `verbatim_quote` (explicit) or `trigger_text` (implicit) |
| **Design** | Documented explicitly | Implicit assumption | `verbatim_quote` (explicit) or `trigger_text` (implicit) |

**Verification procedures:**
- Explicit content: verify `verbatim_quote` exists in stated location
- Implicit content: verify `trigger_text` passages exist and support inference

## Ready to Begin Implementation

The planning phase is now complete with:

1. ✅ **Hybrid approach decided** - Skill-first for verification procedures
2. ✅ **Consistent schema design** - trigger_text for all implicit content
3. ✅ **14 phases sequenced** - Issue #3 → Issue #1 → Issue #2
4. ✅ **Verification consistency** - Same pattern for implicit arguments and implicit methods
5. ✅ **Documentation complete** - Change tracking and implementation order ready

**You can now proceed with Phase 1 (Schema changes) when ready.**

---

## Context Remaining

Approximately **111,700 tokens remaining** (~59% of total context)

Sufficient to complete:
- Phase 1: Schema changes
- Phase 2: Create verification-procedures.md skill
- Phase 3: Update prompts (lean versions)
- Potentially Phase 4: Initial testing setup

---

**Next step:** Confirm you're ready to begin Phase 1 (Schema changes) or if you'd like any refinements to the plan first.
