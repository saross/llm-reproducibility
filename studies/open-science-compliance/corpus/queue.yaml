# Open Science Compliance Study - Phase 1 Queue
# Tracks paper processing for the pilot study
#
# Workflow per paper:
# 1. Obtain PDF and extract text
# 2. Run full extraction pipeline (Pass 0-7)
# 3. Run classification (Pass 8)
# 4. Run credibility assessment (Clusters 1-3)
# 5. Assess FAIR compliance (infrastructure fields)
# 6. Attempt reproduction (if code+data available)
# 7. Document findings

# Verdict criteria (formalised 2026-01-17):
#   Verdict is based on PRIMARY SIGNAL MEAN (not aggregate). Thresholds:
#   ≥85 = Excellent | 70-84 = Good | 55-69 = Acceptable | 40-54 = Weak | <40 = Very Weak
#   Primary signals for methodological/meta-research: Comprehensibility, Transparency, Reproducibility
#   See: .claude/skills/research-assessor/references/credibility/verdict-criteria.md
#
# Verdicts by primary signal mean:
#   1. crema-et-al-2024: Excellent (primary mean 90.0)
#   2. marwick-2025: Excellent (primary mean 88.3)
#   3. dye-et-al-2023: Good (primary mean 84.3)
#   4. herskind-riede-2024: Good (primary mean 81.7)
#   5. key-et-al-2024: Good (primary mean 78.0)
#
# Reproduction priority queue:
#   1. crema-et-al-2024 (90/100 reproducibility, execution_feasibility: ready)

#   5. dye-et-al-2023 (80/100 reproducibility, execution_feasibility: ready)
#
# Methodology finding: Session-per-pass extraction yielded +75% claims, +100% research designs
# vs autonomous for complex methodological papers. Recommended for remaining pilot papers.
#
# Text vs PDF finding: Text extraction achieves 91.5% of PDF counts. PDF preferred for
# page number preservation. See archive/extraction-runs/key-et-al-2024-text-vs-pdf-comparison/
#
# Phase 1 status: COMPLETE. All 5 pilot papers have completed full extraction and assessment
# pipeline (Pass 0-9). Next step: reproduction attempts starting with crema-et-al-2024.
