  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is a novel Bayesian framework for inferring diffusion curves from radiocarbon data, not substantive archaeological findings. Core claims (C001, C002, C010-C014) are methodological arguments about method properties: 'Novel Bayesian framework' (C001), 'Method overcomes SPD limitations' (C002), 'Parametric model provides numerical estimates; non-parametric ICAR provides visual exploration' (C011). Research design RD001 explicitly frames the goal as 'Develop Bayesian inferential tools for modelling diffusion of innovation curves'. The three empirical case studies (Japan rice, British farming, British burials) serve a demonstrative function - showing the method works and what it can reveal - rather than constituting the primary contribution. The 'Results' section reports model parameter estimates and validation diagnostics, not primarily substantive archaeological findings.",

(2) Pre-specified performance criteria: parameter recovery accuracy within 95% posterior range. (3) Systematic testing before empirical application: 'The robustness of the two approaches was first tested against simulated datasets and then applied to investigate three case studies' (Abstract). (4) Posterior predictive checking with pre-specified diagnostic approach (1000 posterior samples, comparison to observed SPD). This is paradigmatic deductive validation: hypothesise method will work → test against known-truth data → apply to empirical cases."

Claims C003 and C004 explicitly test predictions about model behaviour. Confidence is high because the validation strategy is explicit, consistent, and well-documented.

Secondary signals: Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the method (does it do what authors claim?).

  "classification_notes": "Exemplary methodological paper with deductive validation strategy. Notable features: (1) Pre-registration equivalent: simulation parameters and validation criteria specified before testing (functionally equivalent to pre-registration for method validation). (2) Dual model approach: parametric for hypothesis testing, non-parametric for exploration - explicitly stated and appropriate. (3) Posterior predictive checking: conservative approach to model assessment documented. (4) Code review: Ben Marwick reviewed computational code (acknowledged in paper), adding independent verification of reproducibility. (5) Case studies demonstrate genuine archaeological value beyond method demonstration, but method is clearly the primary contribution. This paper could serve as a template for methodological paper best practices in computational archaeology."
