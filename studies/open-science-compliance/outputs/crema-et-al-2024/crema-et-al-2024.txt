    Our hierarchical approach was able to accurately recover the shape
of the diffusion curve in both simulated datasets, with the ‘true’ curve
within the 95% posterior fitted range (Fig. 2a and b). Posteriors of all
parameters were also recovered accurately with fairly narrow highest
posterior density intervals (HPDI), suggesting that good precision can
potentially be achieved for all parameter estimates with the sample sizes
available (Fig. S1 - Fig. S2).
    Results of the posterior predictive checks of the Japanese and British
datasets (Figs. 3 and 4) have, instead, revealed a poor fit between the               Fig. 4. Posterior predictive check of the fitted hierarchical Model on observed
