  primary_type: code_centric
  rationale: |
    Methods development paper introducing novel Bayesian framework for analysing
    radiocarbon-dated diffusion curves. Primary contribution is the statistical
    methodology implemented in R. Case study data is secondary (published datasets
    from other sources: Kudo et al. 2023, Crema et al. 2022, Bevan et al. 2017).
    Simulation data generated as validation, shared with code.

data_fair_assessment:

  applicability: not_applicable
  applicability_rationale: |
    This is a methods development paper using secondary data. The radiocarbon
    datasets are published by other authors and properly cited:
    - Japanese data: Kudo et al. 2023; Crema et al. 2022
    - British farming data: Bevan et al. 2017
    - British burial data: Multiple published sources

    The paper does not generate new primary data requiring independent archival.
    Simulation data (generated for validation) is included with the code repository,
    appropriately bundled with the methods.

  data_fair_score: 0
  data_fair_max: 15
  data_fair_rating: not_applicable

  data_fair_rationale: |
    Data score of 0 reflects "not applicable" (no penalty), not "not fair".
    Secondary analysis paper using published datasets from other sources.
    Appropriate practice: cite-only for existing data. Simulation validation
    data bundled with code repository.

    Level 2: Code + dependencies. R scripts with documented package dependencies
    (NIMBLE, nimbleCarbon, IntCal20). Higher than typical HASS papers. Would

fair_profile:
  summary: "Highly FAIR (code-centric)"
  narrative: |
    Exemplary FAIR compliance for a computational archaeology methods paper.

    CODE (primary output): 15/15 (100%) - Highly FAIR
    - GitHub with Zenodo DOI archival
    - CC BY licence
    - Full dependency documentation
    - Expert code review by Ben Marwick
    - Complete MCMC parameter specification

    DATA (secondary analysis): N/A - uses published datasets

    This paper demonstrates best practice for JAS computational methods papers.
    The combination of permanent archival (Zenodo DOI), open licensing (CC BY),
    expert code review, and detailed parameter documentation provides strong
    foundation for computational reproducibility.

  strengths:
    - Permanent code archival with DOI (Zenodo)
    - Expert code review (Ben Marwick, JAS Reproducibility Specialist)
    - Full MCMC parameter documentation
    - CC BY licence enabling reuse
    - CRediT author contributions
    - Comprehensive funding documentation

  areas_for_improvement:
    - Random seeds not explicitly documented (typical for field, minor gap)
    - No containerised environment (Docker/Singularity)
    - Author ORCIDs not found in paper

  recommendations:
    - Add renv.lock file for exact R package version capture
    - Consider Docker container for complete reproducibility
    - Include random seeds in code for exact MCMC reproducibility
    - Add CITATION.cff to repository

  context_notes: |
    2024 publication assessed against current FAIR standards. JAS has had
    mandatory reproducibility reviews since March 2023, and this paper shows
    the benefits of that policy. Code review by Ben Marwick is notable positive
    signal. Paper represents high end of FAIR compliance for computational
    archaeology.
