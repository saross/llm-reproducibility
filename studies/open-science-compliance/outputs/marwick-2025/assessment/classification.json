  "paper_type": "meta_research",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper studies research practices and scientific processes in archaeology. Research papers themselves are the primary data source: ~10,000 bibliometric records from Web of Science and 47 reproducibility reviews of 25 manuscripts. The paper does NOT use methods to investigate archaeological phenomena; it investigates HOW archaeological research is conducted, reported, and reproduced. This is classic meta-research/scientometrics: measuring disciplinary characteristics through publication patterns and assessing reproducibility practices through systematic review. The two components (bibliometric analysis + reproducibility review) both study research practices rather than substantive archaeological questions.",

      "claims_structure": "Claims are predominantly pattern descriptions and interpretations: 'Archaeology is positioned between natural and social sciences' (C001), 'JAS sits between conservation ecology and geosciences' (C020), 'Incomplete compendia mostly attributable to accidental carelessness' (C041). No hypothesis tests. Claims describe emergent patterns from bibliometric data and reproducibility reviews.",
      "methods_application": "Methods used for systematic documentation and pattern discovery: bibliometric variable extraction from ~10,000 articles, Bayesian GAMs for temporal trend analysis, PCA for journal positioning, categorical analysis of reproducibility failures. No pre-specified predictions or confirmatory testing procedures. Methods designed for comprehensive description.",

Reproducibility reviews → success/failure categorisation → issue taxonomy → recommendations. Both components follow inductive sequence: data collection → pattern identification → interpretation.

Absence of explicit methodology statement is common in meta-research/scientometrics papers which often let methods speak for themselves. Not problematic given clear procedural documentation."

    "approach": "inductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly inductive meta-research. The paper systematically documents patterns in archaeological publication practices and reproducibility outcomes without testing pre-specified hypotheses. Bibliometric analysis describes where archaeology falls on hard-soft spectrum (pattern description, not hypothesis test). Reproducibility review documents success rates and failure modes (systematic observation, not confirmatory testing). Claims are framed as pattern descriptions ('archaeology is positioned...', 'most common issue was...') and interpretations ('urgent need for cultural shifts'). Analytical workflow follows inductive sequence throughout. No evidence of a priori predictions or confirmatory design. Classification is unambiguous."

Bibliometric procedures well-documented: WoS query parameters, journal selection criteria, variable definitions (Price index, relative title length, etc.). Reproducibility review protocol clearly described: eligibility criteria, review procedures, success definitions. Full research compendium available on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14897252). Transparency is excellent at procedural level; gap is only at research design framing level."

Primary signals: (1) Transparency - bibliometric and review procedures documented with full code availability; (2) Comprehensibility - patterns clearly described and interpreted; (3) Reproducibility - full research compendium enables reproduction. Robustness deemphasised as systematic description (not testing sensitivity of conclusions to analytical choices). Validity important for bibliometric variable appropriateness. Generalisability relevant for scope of conclusions about archaeology as discipline."

  "classification_notes": "Meta-research paper combining two components: (1) bibliometric scientometrics studying ~10,000 papers, (2) systematic reproducibility review of 47 submissions. Both components are inductive pattern documentation. Paper is highly relevant to this project's goals as it provides first-hand assessment of reproducibility practices in archaeological science. Author (Ben Marwick) is JAS Associate Editor for Reproducibility - paper reflects insider perspective on reproducibility challenges. Exemplary research compendium demonstrates reproducibility practices the paper advocates."
