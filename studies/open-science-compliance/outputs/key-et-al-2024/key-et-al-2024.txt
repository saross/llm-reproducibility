                                                         Validation tests demonstrate OLE to be capable of providing broadly accurate estimates for the true morpho­

                                                         assemblage used and the method is shown to function well using as few as five records (k) from an assemblage.
                                                         The case studies reveal how OLE can overhaul or reinforce our understanding of artefact morphological ranges.
                                                         In some instances, it is clear that the archaeological record provides a highly accurate representation of artefact

Mean and range data for the Paleoindian point samples, alongside the minimum and maximum values (TE) for these four artefact types modelled using OLE. The extent
of range extension through the OLE method, expressed as a percentage, is also displayed. Sample sizes varied between point types (Clovis [n = 810, except mass where
n = 101], Eastern Clovis [n = 228, except mass where n = 63], Folsom [n = 179, except mass where n = 125], Midland [n = 64]). Length, breadth and thickness were
recorded in mm following Buchanan and Hamilton (2021). Mass was recorded in grams using digital scales.

Table 7
Range data for each morphological variable investigated in the geometric microlith case study. Alongside these data are OLE estimated limits for each attribute (TE)
and data range extensions following the OLE estimates expressed as a percentage. Length, breadth, thickness and area values are recorded in millimetres (mm). ‘Na’
indicates that estimates were not able to be returned because there were duplicate records. Note that the mean values for PC1 and PC2 are not presented as by definition
they approach zero with only very minor variation.
