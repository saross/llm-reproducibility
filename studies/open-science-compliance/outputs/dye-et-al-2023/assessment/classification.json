(2013) event time approach. No formal hypothesis-testing of method performance, but systematic demonstration of method capabilities."

This is inference to best explanation - proposing the substance time framework as the best conceptual tool for understanding artifact phylogenies. The inductive case study is subordinate demonstration, not the primary contribution. For methodological papers, this abductive structure (framework as solution to methodological problem) is typical."
