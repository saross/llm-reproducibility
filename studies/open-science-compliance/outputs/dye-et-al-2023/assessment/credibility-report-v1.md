## Executive Summary

**Overall Verdict:** Good (primary signal mean 84.3/100)

**Aggregate Score:** 77/100 (all signals)

This methodological paper introduces a framework for distinguishing "substance time" (genealogical relations among artifacts) from "event time" (stratigraphic relations) in Bayesian chronological modelling. The framework applies Allen's interval algebra to identify modes of change (branching, transformation, reticulation) from probability distributions.

**Key strengths:**
- Excellent transparency and comprehensibility (scores 85-88)
- High reproducibility enabled by ArchaeoPhases R package on CRAN
- Rigorous mathematical framework with well-documented derivations
- Clear theoretical contribution to archaeological chronology methods

**Key limitations:**
- Case study is illustrative rather than validating (no ground truth comparison)
- Moderate robustness (single analytical framework, no sensitivity testing)
- Supplement materials lack independent DOI for long-term archiving

## Paper Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Paper Type | Methodological |
| Primary Approach | Abductive |
| Secondary Approaches | Inductive (case study demonstration) |
| Validation Approach | Mixed (theoretical derivation + empirical demonstration) |
| Taxonomy Fit | Excellent |

**Classification Notes:** Paper presents theoretical/analytical framework (substance time + Allen's interval algebra) for chronology construction. The Anglo-Saxon bead case study is illustrative demonstration, not the primary contribution. Paper explicitly positions itself as initiating best practices discussion.

## Pillar Assessments

### Pillar 1: Transparency (Foundational Clarity)

**Cluster Score:** 86.5/100 (Excellent)

The paper demonstrates excellent foundational clarity. The theoretical framework distinguishing event time from substance time is clearly articulated with precise definitions. Core claims are explicitly stated (8 core claims identified), and the logical structure from research designs through methods to protocols is fully traceable.

**Strengths:**
- Event time vs substance time distinction operationally defined
- Allen's interval algebra framework mathematically specified
- 8 methods and 10 protocols documented
- Alternative approaches explicitly compared (Bayliss et al. 2013)

**Limitations:**
- Three implicit protocols (similarity estimation, transformation/reticulation inference)
- Supplement lacks independent DOI
- Some assumed familiarity with OxCal and Bayesian methods

### Pillar 2: Credibility (Evidential Strength)

**Cluster Score:** 72/100 (Good)

The paper demonstrates good evidential strength, appropriate for a methodological paper. The proposed framework is grounded in established theory (Allen's interval algebra, Bayesian chronology) and formally derived. The case study demonstrates method applicability but does not validate correctness against ground truth.

**Strengths:**
- Framework builds on established theoretical foundations
- Mathematical derivations are formally valid
- Event time comparison provides context for contribution
- Scope appropriately bounded ("start discussion of best practices")

**Limitations:**
- Case study is illustrative, not validating
- No ground truth comparison for inferred genealogical relations
- Single analytical framework without sensitivity testing
- Some procedures not fully operationalised

### Pillar 3: Reproducibility

**Cluster Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

The paper demonstrates excellent reproducibility infrastructure. Core analytical components are accessible through ArchaeoPhases R package (CRAN), with OxCal model code and R scripts in supplementary materials. Data sources are documented with DOIs.

**Strengths:**
- ArchaeoPhases on CRAN (stable, maintained, open source)
- OxCal model code in supplement
- Data from Archaeological Data Service with DOI
- 10 protocols document analytical procedures

**Limitations:**
- Supplement lacks independent DOI
- OxCal is proprietary (though free)
- Three implicit protocols may require clarification
- Environment specification partial (R version, ArchaeoPhases version not specified)

|-----------|-------|------------|
| Findable | 7/10 | Paper DOI present, 100% author ORCIDs, ArchaeoPhases on CRAN. Supplement lacks DOI. |
| Accessible | 7/10 | Open access via White Rose repository. CRAN package openly available. |
| Interoperable | 6/10 | Standard formats (R, OxCal). Uses ADS dataset. No formal data schema. |
| Reusable | 6/10 | CC-BY-NC-ND paper licence. ArchaeoPhases GPL. Supplement licence unclear. |
| **Total** | **26/40 (65%)** | Moderately FAIR |

## Reproducibility Readiness

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Inputs available | ✓ Yes (ADS dataset with DOI) |
| Code available | ✓ Yes (ArchaeoPhases on CRAN + supplement) |
| Environment specified | ◐ Partial (OxCal version, IntCal20; R version missing) |
| Outputs documented | ✓ Yes (figures, probability estimates) |
| **Execution feasibility** | **Ready** |

**Reproduction attempt priority:** HIGH

**Recommended for reproduction attempt** as part of pilot study. ArchaeoPhases on CRAN provides stable starting point. Main challenge is OxCal version compatibility and implicit protocol clarification.

## Strengths and Limitations Summary

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear theoretical contribution:** Event time vs substance time distinction fills genuine methodological gap
2. **Rigorous mathematical framework:** Allen's interval algebra derivations are formally valid and fully documented
3. **Excellent transparency:** Methods and protocols clearly documented, code available
4. **Strong infrastructure:** 100% author ORCID coverage, CRAN package, ADS data with DOI
5. **Appropriate scope:** Paper explicitly positions itself as initiating discussion, not providing definitive answers

### Key Limitations

1. **Illustrative case study:** No ground truth validation of inferred genealogical relations
2. **Moderate robustness:** Single analytical framework, no sensitivity testing
3. **Implicit protocols:** Similarity estimation and reticulation inference not fully specified
4. **Supplement archiving:** Materials attached to journal rather than independently archived with DOI
5. **Mixed software dependencies:** OxCal (proprietary but free) + R (open source)

## Recommendations

### For Future Users of This Method

1. When applying substance time analysis, document similarity estimation procedures explicitly
2. Consider sensitivity analysis for mode inference thresholds
3. Archive code and data in stable repositories with DOIs when publishing applications

### For Reproduction Attempt

1. Install OxCal 4.4.2 for version compatibility
2. Use IntCal20 calibration curve as specified
3. Contact authors for clarification on implicit protocols (P008-P010) if needed
4. Verify MCMC convergence with five independent runs as documented

### For Methodology Development

1. Future work should validate inferred genealogical relations against independent evidence
2. Sensitivity testing for different similarity estimation approaches would strengthen framework
3. Consider providing containerised computational environment for long-term reproducibility
