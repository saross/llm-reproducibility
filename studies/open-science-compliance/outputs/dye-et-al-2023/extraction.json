RJD contributed key bibliographic references to the evolutionary archaeology literature and augmented the argument that distinguishes the effects of the phase deposition model. AP maintains the ArchaeoPhases software, improved the R code for tempo and occurrence plots, and augmented their description in the text. TSD drafted the main manuscript text, the supplementary material and prepared the figures. All authors offered comments on multiple iterations of the draft text and figures and together produced the final manuscript.",
