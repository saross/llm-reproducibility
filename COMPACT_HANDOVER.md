**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Context Window:** Approaching limit, preparing for /compact

## Work Completed This Session

### Phase 2: Implicit RDMAP Extraction Improvements ✅

Implemented all 3 planned improvements to `extraction-system/prompts/04-rdmap_pass1b_implicit_prompt.md`:

**Fix 4: Reframed Priority (Lines 35-49)**
- Changed from "assessment-critical" to "PRIMARY CONTENT with equal priority"
- Added explicit statement: "Do not skip implicit scanning because Methods section exists"
- Clarified that implicit items are found OUTSIDE Methods sections
- **Impact:** Eliminates executor ambiguity about importance

**Fix 6: Embedded Recognition Patterns (New section after line 136)**
- Added self-contained 4-pattern quick reference (28 lines)
- Each pattern: Question + Look for + Example + Basis
- Maintains link to detailed extraction-fundamentals.md
- **Impact:** Core patterns immediately accessible without file switching

**Fix 3: Quality Gates (Lines 189-201)**
- Consolidated from 14 lines to 6 lines
- Changed from field-population checks to process-verification gates
- Requires documentation of scan methodology in extraction_notes
- Requires explanation if zero implicit items found
- **Impact:** Ensures systematic scanning actually occurred

**Final Line Count:** 337 lines (was 304, +33 lines, under 350-line budget)

---

## Architecture Status

**Current Structure:** Split architecture (6 passes)
- Pass 3 (Prompt 03): RDMAP Explicit - 368 lines
- Pass 4 (Prompt 04): RDMAP Implicit - 337 lines ← JUST UPDATED
- Pass 5 (Prompt 05): RDMAP Rationalisation
- Pass 6 (Prompt 06): Validation

**Confirmed:** User does NOT want to reunify prompts. Split architecture is correct approach.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (PENDING - Not Started)
1. **Test split architecture:** Re-extract Sobotkova et al. 2023 using Prompts 03→04
2. **Validate improvements:** Check implicit RDMAP items > 0, ratio 20-40%
3. **Verify scan methodology:** Confirm extraction_notes documents systematic scanning

### Future (DEFERRED - See planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md)

**High Priority:**
- Mandatory fundamentals reading (Prompts 01, 03) - 30 min
- Liberal extraction mental model (Prompts 01, 03) - 30 min

**Medium Priority:**
- Relationship mapping during extraction (Prompts 01, 03) - 45 min
- Verbatim quote quality standards (Prompt 01) - 30 min

**Total future work:** ~2-3 hours for comprehensive extraction improvements

## Files Modified This Session

1. ✅ `extraction-system/prompts/04-rdmap_pass1b_implicit_prompt.md` - Phase 2 improvements
2. ✅ `planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md` - Created comprehensive task breakdown
3. ✅ Previous session: Implemented split architecture (Prompts 03-06, SKILL.md, all references)

**Commit status:** Phase 2 changes NOT YET COMMITTED

## Key Context for Next Session

### What Was Done
- **Phase 1 (Previous session):** Split RDMAP extraction into dedicated prompts (5→6 passes)
- **Phase 2 (This session):** Strengthened implicit RDMAP prompt with 3 targeted improvements

### What Works
- Split architecture maintains cognitive clarity (proven pattern)
- Implicit arguments extraction works well (7 items consistently) - model to follow
- Phase 2 improvements address known weaknesses: priority framing, pattern accessibility, process verification

### What's Pending
- **Critical:** Test split architecture with Phase 2 improvements on Sobotkova paper
- **Expected outcome:** 10-20 implicit RDMAP items (vs 0 previously)
- **Success criteria:**
  - Implicit items > 0
  - Implicit ratio 20-40%
  - extraction_notes documents scan methodology
  - All 4 recognition patterns represented

### Known Issues
None currently identified. Phase 2 improvements target all known weaknesses from diagnostic analysis.

## Important Planning Documents

1. **planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md** - Complete roadmap (30 pages)
   - Phase 2 complete
   - Phase 3 deferred (may not be needed)
   - Future comprehensive extraction improvements documented

2. **planning/implicit-rdmap-extraction-fixes-implementation.md** - Original fix plan
   - Phase 1: Integrated via split architecture (different approach, same goals)
   - Phase 2: Completed this session
   - Phase 3: Deferred pending testing

3. **planning/implicit-extraction-architecture-comparison.md** - Architectural analysis
   - Split vs unified comparison
   - Rationale for split approach
   - Cognitive model separation benefits

## Testing Instructions for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Commit Phase 2 improvements
cd /home/shawn/Code/llm-reproducibility
git add extraction-system/prompts/04-rdmap_pass1b_implicit_prompt.md
git add planning/remaining-tasks-summary.md
git commit -m "Implement Phase 2: Strengthen implicit RDMAP extraction (Fixes 3, 4, 6)

Improvements to Prompt 04 (implicit RDMAP):
- Fix 4: Reframe implicit RDMAP as primary content (+14 lines)
- Fix 6: Embed 4-pattern recognition guide (+28 lines)
- Fix 3: Replace checkboxes with process-verification gates (-8 lines)

Final length: 337 lines (+33 from 304, under 350-line budget)

Changes eliminate executor ambiguity about implicit extraction priority,
provide immediate pattern access without file switching, and ensure
systematic scanning through process verification.
