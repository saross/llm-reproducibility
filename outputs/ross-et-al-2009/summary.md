## Pass-by-Pass Summary

### Pass 1: Liberal Claims/Evidence Extraction

**Approach:** Liberal extraction across 6 section groups, casting wide net for over-extraction

**Section Groups:**

1. Abstract + Introduction (423-424)
2. L'Amastuola Project + Satellite Data (424-425)
3. Methods Part 1: Georeferencing + Image Analysis (425-428)
4. Methods Part 2: Ground Control (428-430)
5. Results + Comparison (430-432)
6. Environment/Geology + Conclusions (432-436)

**Result:** 297 items (112 evidence, 154 claims, 31 implicit arguments)

**Key Focus:**

- Quantitative measurements (study area size, image resolution, discovery counts)
- Methodological assertions (band combination efficacy, NDVI advantages)
- Comparative findings (remote sensing vs. field survey performance)
- Environmental interpretations (soil moisture, vegetation health correlations)

### Pass 2: Rationalize Claims/Evidence

**Approach:** Conservative consolidation appropriate for well-differentiated technical paper

**Consolidations Applied:** 17 operations

- 14 claim mergers (overlapping/redundant content)
- 3 claim deletions (vague/uninformative assertions: C026, C002, C103)

**Result:** 135 claims (19 items removed, 12.3% reduction)

**Notable Consolidations:**

- C017 → C016 (multispectral imagery capabilities)
- C067 → C066 (vegetation marks interpretation)
- C113 → C110 (success rate calculations)
- C148 + C151 → C145 (complementary methods argument)

**Evidence and Implicit Arguments:** Unchanged (112 evidence, 31 implicit arguments)

**Rationale:** Technical paper with distinct quantitative findings warranted conservative approach. Each remaining claim makes unique assertion supported by specific evidence.

### Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction

**Approach:** Liberal extraction using SAME 6 section groups as Pass 1, equal attention to all sections, especially liberal with research designs

**Result:** 37 RDMAP items (4 research designs, 12 methods, 21 protocols)

**Research Designs Extracted:**

- **RD001:** Integrated multi-method archaeological prospection combining remote sensing and field survey
- **RD002:** Comparative evaluation design (QuickBird vs. MTS survey)
- **RD003:** Iterative feedback design (satellite interpretation → ground verification → refined analysis)
- **RD004:** Blind interpretation experimental control

**Key Methods:**

- M001: Manual satellite image interpretation
- M002: Targeted ground control survey
- M005: Quantitative comparative analysis
- M010: Spectral analysis (band combinations + NDVI)

**Notable Protocols:**

- P001: ENVI 4.3 image processing workflow
- P005: Band combination sequences (4-2-1; 4-1-2; 4-1-4)
- P020: NDVI calculation and vegetation assessment
- P021: Comprehensive georeferencing (14m → 3m RMSE improvement)

### Pass 4: Implicit RDMAP Extraction

**Approach:** Systematic scan for mentioned-but-undocumented procedures

**Result:** 8 implicit RDMAP items (7 protocols + 1 method)

**Implicit Protocols Identified:**

- IP001: Image processing software/hardware specifications
- IP002: Feature inventory and tracking procedure
- IP003: Grab sample collection and processing
- IP004: Ground control team training/calibration
- IP005: Surface visibility assessment and correction calculation
- IP006: Field data recording and documentation system
- IP007: Statistical significance testing procedure

**Implicit Method:**

- IM001: Grab sampling for period/function determination from artefact assemblages

**Reconstruction Confidence:** Mostly low (5/8 items) due to minimal procedural description

**Pattern:** Many implicit procedures reference MTS (Metaponto Survey) methods but without detailing them in this paper.

### Pass 5: Rationalize RDMAP

**Approach:** Conservative consolidation preserving well-differentiated technical procedures

**Consolidations Applied:** 4 items removed (8.9% reduction)

**Method Consolidations:**

- M010 + M011 → M010 (spectral analysis method combining manual band recombination and NDVI)

**Protocol Consolidations:**

- P002 + P003 → P021 (comprehensive georeferencing and projection procedure)
- P019 → P005 (redundant restatement of same band combination set)

**Final RDMAP:** 41 items (4 designs, 12 methods, 25 protocols)

**Rationale:** Technical methods paper with well-differentiated procedures. Conservative 8.9% reduction preserves distinct methodological steps. Each remaining RDMAP item describes unique procedure or design element.

### Pass 6: Validation and Repair

**Initial Validation:** FAIL (19 critical cross-reference issues)

**Issue Identified:** Pass 2 claim consolidations/deletions created broken references in evidence.supports_claims and implicit_argument.related_claims fields

**Repair Applied:** 19 reference updates

- 12 evidence reference repairs
- 7 implicit_argument reference repairs
- Mapping deleted claims (C002, C103) → removal
- Mapping consolidated claims (e.g., C017 → C016) → valid replacement

**Re-validation:** PASS (with 4 acceptable warnings)

**Cross-reference Integrity:**

- ✓ All claim→evidence references valid
- ✓ All evidence→claim references valid
- ✓ All implicit_argument→claim references valid
- ✓ All RDMAP hierarchy links valid
- ✓ 100% sourcing completeness
- ✓ All page numbers valid

**Acceptable Warnings:** 4 methods without child protocols (M003, M004, M009, IM001) - reflects conceptual methods or insufficient procedural documentation in source paper

## Key Findings and Characteristics

### Research Question

Can high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (QuickBird) efficiently detect archaeological sites compared to traditional intensive field survey?

### Methodological Approach

**Comparative evaluation design** testing remote sensing against established ground truth:

- **Remote sensing:** QuickBird satellite imagery (0.61m panchromatic, 2.44m multispectral)
- **Ground truth:** Metaponto Survey (MTS) intensive field survey results
- **Study area:** 100 sq km (25 km²  analysed in detail)
- **Experimental control:** Blind interpretation (no prior knowledge of MTS discoveries)

### Core Methods

1. **Spectral analysis:** Manual band combinations (red/NIR emphasis) + NDVI transformation
2. **Feature detection:** Visual interpretation identifying 123 features of interest
3. **Ground verification:** Targeted field visits to 44 selected features (35.8% sample)
4. **Comparative analysis:** Success rates, false positives/negatives, efficiency metrics

### Key Results

**Discovery Performance:**

- 29 archaeological sites/scatters discovered in analysed area
- 3× exceedance over randomly chosen area of equal size
- 66% success rate (29/44 ground-verified features were archaeological)
- 9 MTS sites missed, 20 new sites discovered

**Efficiency:**

- Remote sensing: 6 person-days for 100 sq km
- MTS field survey: ~200 person-days for equivalent area
- 97% time savings while maintaining comparable discovery rates

**False Positives:** Primarily geological features (palaeochannels, tufa deposits)

**Environmental Correlations:**

- Best performance in well-watered lowland areas (Quaternary alluvium)
- Vegetation stress marks reveal subsurface archaeological features
- NDVI effective for automated vegetation health assessment

### Transparency and Documentation

**High transparency in:**

- Quantitative results (specific counts, percentages, statistical comparisons)
- Technical specifications (sensor resolution, georeferencing accuracy, software)
- Methodological procedures (band combinations, NDVI calculation, ground control protocols)

**Lower transparency in:**

- Software/hardware specifications (platforms mentioned but not fully detailed)
- Team training and calibration procedures
- Statistical significance testing methods
- Sample processing workflows

**Implicit RDMAP rate (19.5%)** indicates moderately good methodological documentation, with most core procedures explicitly described but supporting workflows left implicit.

## Notable Methodological Elements

### Experimental Rigor

- **Blind interpretation control:** Satellite analysis completed before accessing MTS database, preventing bias
- **Quantitative ground verification:** 35.8% of identified features field-verified (statistically robust sample)
- **Iterative refinement:** Ground control feedback improved subsequent image interpretation

### Technical Innovation

- **Multi-method integration:** Combines spectral analysis, vegetation indices, and targeted ground survey
- **Efficiency optimization:** Focuses field effort on high-probability features identified remotely
- **Georeferencing accuracy:** RMSE improvement from 14m to 3m through ground control points

### Comparative Framework

- **Established baseline:** MTS survey provides ground truth for validation
- **Quantitative metrics:** Success rates, false positive/negative counts, time efficiency
- **Complementary interpretation:** Remote sensing and field survey excel in different contexts

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **100% sourcing completeness:** Every extracted item traceable to verbatim quote or trigger text
2. **Comprehensive RDMAP extraction:** 41 items capturing research designs, methods, and protocols
3. **Robust cross-referencing:** All evidence-claim and RDMAP hierarchy links validated
4. **Balanced extraction:** Liberal Pass 1/3 followed by conservative Pass 2/5 rationalization
5. **High methodological transparency:** Technical procedures well-documented

### Limitations

1. **Implicit RDMAP:** 19.5% of methods/protocols mentioned but not fully documented
2. **Low reconstruction confidence:** 5/8 implicit items have insufficient detail for replication
3. **Methods without protocols:** 4 methods lack documented child protocols (conceptual methods or insufficient detail)
4. **Workflow gaps:** Software stack, team training, sample processing not fully specified

### Extraction Challenges

1. **Technical density:** Methods sections required careful parsing to distinguish methods from protocols
2. **Distributed RDMAP:** Research designs found across Introduction, Methods, and Conclusions (not just Methods)
3. **Implicit procedures:** Many workflows referenced external sources (MTS) without re-documenting
4. **Conservative rationalization:** Well-differentiated technical content limited consolidation opportunities (12.3% and 8.9% reductions vs. 15-20% targets)

## Recommendations for Replication

### Well-Documented (High Confidence)

- Image acquisition specifications (QuickBird sensor characteristics)
- Georeferencing procedure (RMSE improvement, coordinate system)
- Band combination sequences (specific NIR/red combinations)
- NDVI calculation methodology
- Ground control sampling strategy (feature selection criteria)

### Requires Clarification (Medium Confidence)

- Image processing software stack and versions
- Feature inventory database structure
- Visibility correction calculation method
- Statistical significance testing procedures

### Insufficient Detail (Low Confidence)

- Team training and inter-observer calibration
- Grab sample collection and processing protocols
- Field data recording forms/systems
- Hardware specifications for image analysis

### Suggested Documentation Improvements

1. **Software environment:** Specify versions, platforms, computational requirements
2. **Procedural protocols:** Document training, calibration, and quality control steps
3. **Data structures:** Detail inventory systems, recording forms, database schemas
4. **Statistical methods:** Specify tests, significance thresholds, confidence intervals

## Conclusion

This extraction successfully captures the methodological framework of Ross et al. 2009's comparative remote sensing study. The paper demonstrates **high transparency** in technical specifications and quantitative results, with **moderate documentation** of procedural workflows (19.5% implicit RDMAP). The extraction yields **319 items** representing a comprehensive map of the research's epistemological structure, from high-level research designs (integrated multi-method approach, comparative evaluation) through specific protocols (band combinations, georeferencing steps).

The **conservative rationalization approach** (12.3% claims, 8.9% RDMAP) appropriately preserves the well-differentiated technical content characteristic of remote sensing methodology papers. **100% sourcing completeness** ensures all extracted items are traceable to specific locations in the source text, supporting verification and quality control.

Key **replication insights**: While core technical procedures (spectral analysis, ground control sampling) are well-documented, supporting workflows (team training, sample processing, data management systems) remain implicit. Future methodological papers in this domain would benefit from documenting software environments, procedural protocols, and statistical testing methods with the same rigour applied to sensor specifications and image processing techniques.
