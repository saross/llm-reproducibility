## Assessment Scope

**Total Items:** 288
- Evidence: 112
- Claims: 135
- Methods: 12
- Protocols: 25
- Research Designs: 4

## Methodology

Granularity assessment evaluates whether items are appropriately split or consolidated:
- **Over-split** (excessive atomisation): Breaking down information unnecessarily
- **Under-split** (missing detail): Combining distinct concepts inappropriately
- **Inconsistent**: Varying detail levels for comparable items

## Evidence Granularity Assessment (112 items)

### Consolidation Examples

#### E002 - APPROPRIATE
- **Content:** "Ground control combined with high-resolution multispectral imagery evaluation led to the discovery of 29 sites and significant off-site scatters during approximately four weeks of fieldwork."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates outcome (29 sites + scatters), timeframe (4 weeks), and method (combined evaluation). Could have been split into separate items for timeline, site count, and scatter count, but consolidated form is more useful.
- **Assessment:** Appropriate consolidation - maintains functional unity

#### E028 - APPROPRIATE
- **Content:** Consolidates clear sky, environmental quality, and off-nadir angle
- **Analysis:** Three related image quality factors appropriately grouped
- **Assessment:** Appropriate - related technical factors

#### E065 - APPROPRIATE
- **Content:** Site definition criteria for both historical (5 sherds/m²) and prehistoric (2 sherds/m²)
- **Analysis:** Could have split into two separate criteria but paired comparison is functionally useful
- **Assessment:** Appropriate - comparative structure valuable

#### E095 - APPROPRIATE
- **Content:** "The discovery of 29 sites and off-site scatters exceeds the number expected from a randomly chosen area of equal size by more than three times."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates actual count (29), expected count (9), and comparison (3x) into single comparative statement
- **Assessment:** Appropriate - maintains statistical relationship

### Potential Over-splits

None identified. Evidence items maintain appropriate consolidation throughout.

### Potential Under-splits

#### E003 - BORDERLINE ACCEPTABLE
- **Content:** "Most detected features in the satellite image reflect geological conditions amenable to past human habitation rather than subsurface archaeological remains."
- **Analysis:** Combines two concepts: (1) features reflect geological conditions, (2) these conditions are amenable to habitation. Could be split but the relationship is core to the finding.
- **Assessment:** Acceptable - the relationship is the key point

## Claims Granularity Assessment (135 items)

### Documented Consolidations

#### C045 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C045 + C046
- **Consolidated:** "Early spring image acquisition (mid-March) optimises both crop mark and soil mark detection by capturing vigorous plant growth that increases vegetation health contrast while maintaining sufficient ground visibility before vegetation obscures soil."
- **Analysis:** Originally two separate claims about (1) crop mark detection and (2) soil mark detection. Consolidated into comprehensive seasonal timing rationale.
- **Assessment:** Excellent - captures complete reasoning

#### C049 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C049 + C083
- **Consolidated:** "Concurrent ground control improves feature identification accuracy through immediate iterative feedback, allowing exclusion of false positive spectral patterns identified early in the process while enabling targeted search for patterns associated with ancient material."
- **Analysis:** Combines time constraint justification with methodological advantage
- **Assessment:** Excellent - complete methodological rationale

#### C056 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C056 + C058
- **Consolidated:** "Georeferencing improved image accuracy to approximately 3 m RMSE, an excellent result facilitated by low off-nadir angle, with no further correction (such as orthorectification) deemed worthwhile since artifact scatter size and variability does not require more precise mapping."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates result, enabling factor, and decision about further processing
- **Assessment:** Excellent - complete technical decision chain

#### C066 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C066 + C067
- **Consolidated:** "Vegetation health variations reveal subsurface archaeology: positive crop marks (healthy vegetation with high NIR, low red) may indicate moist, nutrient-rich features like filled ditches or graves, while negative crop marks (stressed vegetation with low NIR, high red) may reveal dry, infertile conditions from subsurface masonry depriving plants of water and nutrients."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates positive and negative crop mark interpretation
- **Assessment:** Excellent - paired interpretation structure

#### C069 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C069 + C071
- **Consolidated:** "NDVI transformation supplements manual band recombination, used primarily for quickly distinguishing bare from vegetated areas and confirming discoveries rather than as the principal detection means in large study areas with wide variations in ground cover."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates NDVI technique with adapted application for this specific study
- **Assessment:** Excellent - technique + contextual adaptation

#### C097 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C097 + C098
- **Consolidated:** "Iterative learning during concurrent ground control enables adaptive feature identification: early-identified false positive patterns can be eliminated from subsequent analysis while features associated with ancient material can be scrutinised and similar features systematically sought."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates negative learning (false positive elimination) and positive learning (pattern seeking)
- **Assessment:** Excellent - dual learning process

#### C108 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C108 + C111
- **Consolidated:** "Remote sensing detects both sites and significant off-site scatters, with 29 discoveries (14 sites + 15 off-site scatters) representing 25.4% of assessed features yielding significant archaeological surface material."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates site types, counts, and success rate
- **Assessment:** Excellent - complete quantitative summary

#### C110 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C110 + C113
- **Consolidated:** "Remote sensing achieved a 12.3% true positive rate for site-level discoveries (14/114 features), with an additional 13.1% yielding off-site material and 11.4% remaining ambiguous but potentially archaeological, indicating 25.4% confirmed and 36.8% total potential archaeological significance."
- **Analysis:** Complex consolidation of success categories and percentages
- **Assessment:** Excellent - maintains all quantitative detail while creating coherent summary

#### C115 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C115 + C116
- **Consolidated:** "The 63.1% false positive rate resulted primarily from natural phenomena (28.9%, especially geological features) and modern agricultural activity (23.6%), illustrating the challenges of distinguishing archaeological from natural and contemporary features."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates false positive breakdown with interpretive conclusion
- **Assessment:** Excellent - data + interpretation

#### C119 - EXCELLENT
- **Original:** C119 + C140
- **Consolidated:** "The discovery of 29 sites and off-site scatters exceeded random expectation (9 sites) by more than three times, demonstrating that satellite image analysis provides genuine archaeological signal beyond chance association."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates quantitative comparison with methodological interpretation
- **Assessment:** Excellent - statistical result + significance interpretation

#### C134 - MAJOR EXCELLENT CONSOLIDATION
- **Original:** C134 + C138 + C141
- **Consolidated:** "Through a combination of remote sensing characteristics, propitious image timing, water as the limiting resource, and particular geological formations producing near-surface water sources, the majority of detected image features associated with ancient material represent environmental conditions conducive to habitation (zones of near-surface groundwater or moisture-retaining soils) rather than direct subsurface archaeological remains."
- **Analysis:** Major consolidation of core interpretive finding, mechanism, and conclusion
- **Assessment:** Excellent - captures complete causal chain for key finding

#### C136 - GOOD
- **Original:** C136 + C142
- **Consolidated:** "Image analysis was most successful at finding sites in well-watered areas of the broadly xeric region, while producing less successful and more erratic results in uniformly dry areas lacking near-surface water sources."
- **Analysis:** Consolidates positive and negative environmental correlation
- **Assessment:** Good - paired comparison structure

#### C145 - MAJOR EXCELLENT CONSOLIDATION
- **Original:** C145 + C148 + C151
- **Consolidated:** "Differential recovery of archaeological sites by different methods demonstrates that remote sensing has limitations and works best in combination with other prospection methods, particularly archaeological surface survey, as complementary rather than competing techniques."
- **Analysis:** Major methodological recommendation consolidating limitations recognition, complementary approach, and survey integration
- **Assessment:** Excellent - complete methodological position

### Total Consolidations Documented: 16

All consolidations maintain accuracy while improving usability and coherence.

### Potential Over-splits

None identified. No cases of excessive atomisation.

### Potential Under-splits

#### C016 - BORDERLINE ACCEPTABLE
- **Content:** "Only high-resolution multispectral imagery reveals the relatively small soil marks, crop marks, and shadow marks often associated with subsurface archaeological remains, allowing detection of smaller sites, and for the efficient investigation and management of large, archaeologically rich landscapes"
- **Analysis:** Combines three separate points: (1) unique capability of high-res multispectral, (2) detection of smaller sites, (3) landscape-scale efficiency. Could potentially be 2-3 claims but the capabilities are related.
- **Assessment:** Acceptable - capabilities form coherent capability set

#### C028 vs C008 - MARGINAL REDUNDANCY
- **C008:** "The Murge Tableland Survey provides independent definitions for various types of sites and a large comparative sample."
- **C028:** "The MTS provides a comparative dataset for the present remote sensing project."
- **Analysis:** These are very similar, though C008 emphasises "independent definitions" while C028 emphasises "comparative dataset." Could have been consolidated.
- **Assessment:** Marginal but acceptable - slight emphasis difference
