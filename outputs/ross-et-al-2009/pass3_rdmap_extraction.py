Pass 3: Liberal RDMAP Extraction (Research Designs, Methods, Protocols)
Ross et al. 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM USER:
1. Use SAME 6 section groups as Pass 1
2. Liberal extraction - cast wide net, aim for over-extraction (40-50% more)
3. Pay EQUAL attention to ALL sections (not over-focus on Methods)
4. Be ESPECIALLY liberal with research designs (commonly under-extracted)

Section groups (mirroring Pass 1):
1. Abstract + Introduction
2. L'Amastuola Project + Satellite Data
3. Methods (Georeferencing + Image Analysis)
4. Methods (Ground Control)
5. Results + Comparison
6. Environment/Geology + Conclusions

Target: 30-45 RDMAP items (liberal, will rationalize in Pass 5)
