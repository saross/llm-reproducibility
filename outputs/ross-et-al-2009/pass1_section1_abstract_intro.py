Pass 1, Section 1: Liberal Claims/Evidence Extraction
Ross et al. 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy

Section: Abstract + Introduction (~1200 words, pages 423-424)

Approach: Liberal extraction, cast wide net, aim for over-extraction.
Items will be consolidated in Pass 2. When uncertain, include it.

Extraction focus:
- Evidence: Quantitative results, measurements, observations
- Claims: Methodological assertions, comparative statements, interpretations
- Implicit arguments: 4-type scan on core claims

Sourcing discipline: 100% verbatim_quote for all explicit items
