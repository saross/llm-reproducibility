Pass 4: Extract Implicit RDMAP
Ross et al. 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy

Scan for mentioned-but-undocumented procedures (implicit protocols/methods).
Pattern: Mentioned → Undocumented

Common patterns:
- "using X software" but no version/parameters specified
- "trained personnel" but no training procedure documented
- "grab sample collected" but no processing procedure detailed
- "features inventoried" but no recording procedure specified
