JSTOR stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/25608604. Methodological paper on archaeological remote sensing using QuickBird satellite imagery (100 sq km) in Apulia, Italy. Compares remote sensing with ground control (1.45 sq km, 114 features assessed) against Murge Tableland Survey (MTS) systematic survey (10 sq km, 63 sites). Three authors: Ross (UNSW), Sobotkova (U Michigan), Burgers (Royal Netherlands Institute Rome). Remote sensing discovered 29 sites/off-site scatters (plus 13 ambiguous) in ca. 70 person-days vs 63 sites via MTS in ca. 350 person-days. Key finding: image features mostly reflect environmental conditions (near-surface water sources) amenable to settlement rather than subsurface archaeological remains directly. Excellent methodological transparency including false positives (63.1%) and false negatives (51 sites). QuickBird image: 18 March 2004, archival, 0.61m panchromatic, 2.44m multispectral. Methods: georeferencing (RMSE 3m), WGS 84 UTM 33N projection, pansharpening, band combinations (4-2-1, 4-1-2, 4-1-4), NDVI, Principal Component Analysis. No funding statement, no data availability, no code repository, no ORCIDs, no paper DOI (JSTOR only), subscription access. Appropriate transparency for 2009 archaeology/remote sensing publication.
