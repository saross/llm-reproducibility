Pass 2: Claims/Evidence Rationalization
Ross et al. 2009 - Remote Sensing and Archaeological Prospection in Apulia, Italy

Target: 15-20% reduction in claims through consolidation
Approach: Conservative consolidation for technical paper with many distinct findings
Evidence: No reduction (preserve empirical observations)
Implicit Arguments: Minor consolidation if overlapping

Starting counts:
- Evidence: 112 (no reduction target)
- Claims: 154 (target reduction to ~123-130 = 15-20% reduction)
- Implicit Arguments: 31 (minor consolidation only)

Consolidation priorities:
1. Similar methodological assertions (e.g., band combination claims)
2. Overlapping interpretive claims (e.g., what features represent)
3. Redundant effectiveness claims
4. Preserve distinct technical details and specific findings
