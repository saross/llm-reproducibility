## Key Findings

### Strengths

✅ **Perfect RDMAP hierarchy:** All 25 design→method→protocol mappings correct (100%)
✅ **Clear design implementation:** Methods appropriately distributed across designs (RD002: 6 methods, RD004: 3 methods, RD-IMP-001: 3 methods)
✅ **Appropriate protocol decomposition:** M001 realized through 4 pathways (P001-P004), M007 through 3 protocols (P013-P015)
✅ **Strong claim-evidence linkages:** 61/62 strong mappings (98.4%)
✅ **No incorrect mappings:** All relationships valid, only 1 weak connection
✅ **Appropriate abstraction:** Core claims (C001, C002) correctly lack direct evidence, supported through intermediate claims

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **One weak mapping:** C053 → E023 (should be E024) - confirmed Pass A error
⚠️ **Potential breadth issue:** C044 ("all three directors") supported by single director evidence (E020)

---

## Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Multi-Evidence Claim Support
**Examples:** C009 (4 evidence), C018 (5 evidence), C078 (3 evidence)
**Principle:** Complex or comprehensive claims appropriately supported by multiple evidence items

### Pattern 2: Shared Evidence Across Related Claims
**Examples:** E030-E031 support both C067 and C068; E037-E039 support C078-C081
**Principle:** Single evidence item appropriately supports multiple related claims when observation has multiple implications

### Pattern 3: RDMAP Hierarchy Integrity
**Example:** RD002 → M003 (framework) → M004 (specific) → P009, P010 (protocols)
**Principle:** Clear abstraction levels maintained across design→method→protocol chain

### Pattern 4: Implicit Item Consistency
**Example:** RD-IMP-001 → M-IMP-001, M-IMP-002, M-IMP-005 (all implicit)
**Principle:** Implicit designs link to implicit methods; implicit methods lack protocol links

### Pattern 5: Unlinked Technical Protocols
**Examples:** P006-P008 (deployment/cost), P017-P018 (data management), P-IMP-001 to P-IMP-005 (technical procedures)
**Principle:** Infrastructure and data management protocols appropriately separated from research methods

---

## Priority Corrections

### Priority 1: C053 Evidence Mapping

**Action:** Change C053 evidence from E023 to E024

**Current mapping:** C053 → E023 (Fairbairn CSV receipt)
**Correct mapping:** C053 → E024 (VanValkenburgh richness/integrity quote)

**Rationale:** E024 directly addresses data quality improvement ("improved both richness and integrity"), while E023 addresses data availability timing

**Impact:** Minor - internal metadata consistency, already flagged in Pass A

---

## Overall Assessment

**Grade:** A (98.9% strong mappings)

**Quality Tier:** Excellent

**Key Strength:** Perfect RDMAP hierarchy (100%) with strong claim-evidence linkages (98.4%)

**Fitness for Use:** Production-ready with one minor correction (C053 mapping)

**Assessor Confidence:** High - systematic review of all 87 mappings across three relationship types
