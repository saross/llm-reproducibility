## Summary Assessment

### Strengths

- Metrics indicate areas for improvement across most dimensions

### Areas for Improvement

- Consider increasing evidential support for claims (high claims:evidence ratio)
- Expand RDMAP documentation (sparse methods/protocols)
- Consider triangulation with additional evidence types
- Improve replicability infrastructure (PIDs, data/code sharing)
- Strengthen PID connectivity (link PIDs in infrastructure)
- Enhance FAIR compliance (metadata, accessibility, licensing)
- Provide more detailed methodological descriptions

### Corpus Position

**Overall Ranking:** Bottom quartile overall

**Top Quartile Metrics:** None

**Bottom Quartile Metrics:** ESD, TCI, RTI, RIS, PGCS, FCS, MDD

### Flags and Notes

No critical flags

---

## Recommendations

### For Authors

- Archive data and code in repositories with PIDs (e.g., Zenodo, OSF)
- Enhance FAIR compliance: add rich metadata, clear licences, standard formats

### For Reviewers

- Review whether claims are adequately supported by evidence
- Consider whether mono-method approach is appropriate for research question

### For Replication Attempts

- Contact authors for data/code (not publicly available)
- Expect to need additional methodological clarification from authors
- Data may not be accessible or in standard formats; prepare for preprocessing

## Notes on Interpretation

This scorecard presents quantitative metrics for **initial screening and triage**, not final quality judgments. Metrics should be interpreted in conjunction with:

1. **Qualitative review** of actual extracted content
2. **Genre and domain context** (theoretical vs empirical, archival vs experimental)
3. **Temporal context** (publication year relative to FAIR/PID infrastructure norms)
4. **Corpus-relative positioning** (percentiles within this specific corpus)

**Limitations:**
- Metrics measure extraction quality as much as research quality
- Small corpus (10 papers) means unstable percentiles
- No ground truth validation yet
- Fixed thresholds are placeholders needing calibration

See credibility metrics documentation for detailed interpretation guidance.
