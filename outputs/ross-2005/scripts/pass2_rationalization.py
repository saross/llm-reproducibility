Pass 2: Rationalization - Conservative Consolidation

Current: 100 claims, 15 evidence, 8 implicit arguments (123 total)
Target: ~85 claims (15% reduction), 15 evidence (0% reduction), 8 implicit arguments (0% reduction)
Expected final: ~108 items

Consolidation strategy:
1. Merge overlapping claims (same core assertion, different angles)
2. Absorb restatements (later restatement merged into first instance)
3. Delete vague/redundant claims
4. Preserve evidence (textual citations are distinct)
5. Preserve implicit arguments (already selective)
