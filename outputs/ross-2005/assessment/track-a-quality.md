# Track A Quality Assessment

## Quality State: HIGH

**Paper:** ross-2005
**Assessment Date:** 2025-11-30
**Assessor Version:** v1.0

**Decision:** Proceed with full credibility assessment

## Quality Dimensions

### Extraction Confidence: HIGH

**Item counts:**
- Evidence: 17 items (primary source citations from Homeric corpus)
- Claims: 78 items (threshold: 25+ = HIGH)
- Implicit arguments: 8 items
- Research designs: 4 items
- Methods: 9 items
- Protocols: 12 items

**Assessment:** This is an interpretive philological paper with substantial extraction. High claim count (78) reflects the argumentative density typical of classical philology. Evidence items are primarily ancient textual sources (Homer, Hesiod, Homeric Hymns). RDMAP items reflect hermeneutic methodology rather than experimental design.

**Cross-reference integrity:** Complete.

**Sourcing compliance:** 100% verbatim quotes from primary sources.

### Classification Confidence: HIGH

**From classification.json:**
- Primary approach: inductive (confidence: high)
- Paper type: empirical (interpretive)
- Special consideration: Methodological Transparency variant applies
- Taxonomy fit: good

**Assessment:** Clear classification as interpretive humanistic research. Classical Philology journal establishes disciplinary context. Methodological Transparency variant appropriate for non-computational scholarship.

## Gating Decision Rationale

**Quality State: HIGH**

Quality is HIGH because:
- Classification confidence is HIGH
- Extraction counts appropriate for interpretive philology (high claim density, primary sources as evidence)
- No structural problems
- Methodological Transparency variant correctly identified

---

## Implications for Assessment

Full credibility assessment will proceed with:
- Inductive/interpretive anchors
- Precise signal scores (0-100)
- Context flags: Reproducibility 🔧 (Methodological Transparency variant)
- Era context: pre-2015 (Classical Philology 2005)
