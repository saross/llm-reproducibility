# Pass 2 Rationalization Analysis
## Penske et al. 2023

### Current State (Pass 1)
- **Evidence:** 94 items
- **Claims:** 92 items  
- **Implicit Arguments:** 19 items
- **Total:** 205 items

### Target (Pass 2)
- 15-20% reduction → Target 164-174 items
- Focus: Conservative consolidation without information loss

### Consolidation Candidates

#### Evidence Consolidation Patterns

**1. Identical Support Pattern (Primary Method)**
- E019-E020: Both support C025 (PIE039 genetic similarity), likely consolidatable
- E021-E022: Both about Hungary_LN_Sopot/Malak Preslavets N relationship to PIE039
- E039-E041: Three Y-haplogroup observations (Pietrele, Varna, Yunatsite) - may consolidate with view pattern
- Multiple genetic statistics showing similar patterns across sites

**2. Compound Findings**
- E087-E088: Both about radiocarbon dating procedure → single methodological evidence
- E092-E093: Sample numbers + lab location → single methodological evidence

**3. Assessment Compatibility**
- Multiple f4-statistics results that are never assessed independently
- Site identification evidence (E009, E010) supporting same claim

#### Claims Consolidation Patterns

**1. Narrative Consolidation**
- C085-C086: Radiocarbon dating method and calibration → integrated methodological claim
- C089-C090: DNA extraction and enrichment → integrated laboratory claim

**2. Compound Interpretation**
- C058-C059: Two EBA genetic clusters → could integrate into single bimodal pattern claim
- C071-C072: Genetic homogeneity + stable network → integrated sociopolitical claim

**3. Overlapping Interpretations**
- Multiple claims about genetic continuity (C010, C032, C033) - check for redundancy
- Claims about admixture patterns that may overlap

#### Implicit Arguments

**Review for potential consolidation:**
- IA001-IA002: Both about genetic data reliability and admixture interpretation
- IA006-IA008: Multiple methodological assumptions about genetic analysis

### Conservative Approach
- Only consolidate when clearly redundant or identical support pattern
- Preserve technical distinctions in genetics (different statistics, different populations)
- Document all consolidations with complete metadata
- Update cross-references systematically

### Estimated Reductions
- Evidence: 94 → ~76 (19% reduction, 18 consolidations)
- Claims: 92 → ~76 (17% reduction, 16 consolidations) 
- Implicit Arguments: 19 → ~17 (10% reduction, 2 consolidations)
- **Total: 205 → ~169 (18% reduction)**
