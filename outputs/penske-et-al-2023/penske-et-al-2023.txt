Archaeogenetic studies have described two main genetic turnover events in
prehistoric western Eurasia: one associated with the spread of farming and a sedentary
lifestyle starting around 7000–6000 bc (refs. 1–3) and a second with the expansion
of pastoralist groups from the Eurasian steppes starting around 3300 bc (refs. 4,5).
The period between these events saw new economies emerging on the basis of key
innovations, including metallurgy, wheel and wagon and horse domestication6–9.
However, what happened between the demise of the Copper Age settlements around
4250 bc and the expansion of pastoralists remains poorly understood. To address this
question, we analysed genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals from the contact
zone between southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region spanning
this critical time period. While we observe genetic continuity between Neolithic and
Copper Age groups from major sites in the same region, from around 4500 bc on,
groups from the northwestern Black Sea region carried varying amounts of mixed
ancestries derived from Copper Age groups and those from the forest/steppe zones,
indicating genetic and cultural contact over a period of around 1,000 years earlier than
anticipated. We propose that the transfer of critical innovations between farmers and
transitional foragers/herders from different ecogeographic zones during this early
contact was integral to the formation, rise and expansion of pastoralist groups around
3300 bc.
During the fifth and fourth millennia bc, key technological and social Măgura Gorgana near Pietrele on the Lower Danube in Romania14,
