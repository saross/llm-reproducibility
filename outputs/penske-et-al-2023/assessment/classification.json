  "paper_type_justification": "This paper collects and analyses empirical data (genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals) to investigate phenomena in the world (genetic and cultural contact between Copper Age farming groups and Eneolithic steppe-associated groups). Claims describe, explain, and test predictions about prehistoric population dynamics. Methods (ancient DNA extraction, PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm modelling) are tools used to investigate the research question, not the subject being investigated. Primary contribution is understanding population history during 5400-2400 BC, not presenting genetic analysis methodology.",

Statistical hypothesis testing throughout (f4-statistics, qpAdm model fit tests).",

Explicit hypothesis rejection for pathogen hypothesis. Deductive validation workflow with model testing."

  "classification_notes": "Straightforward deductive empirical research. Classification matches expected outcome (empirical/deductive). Paper demonstrates exemplary hypothesis-testing structure for archaeogenetics: explicit hypothesis rejection (pathogen hypothesis), statistical model testing (qpAdm with p-values), and revision of prior expectations (contact timing). Note: Paper is co-authored by user (Shawn Ross) - classification conducted without bias based on extraction evidence. Nature publication standards support high transparency assessment."
