  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This is a high-profile archaeogenetics study analysing genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals to investigate genetic and cultural contact between Copper Age farming groups and Eneolithic steppe-associated groups. The paper generates new empirical data (ancient DNA sequences), applies multiple analytical methods, and makes claims about prehistoric population dynamics based on genetic evidence. Primary contribution is empirical findings about genetic ancestry and contact patterns.",

      "claims_structure": "Claims are predominantly pattern descriptions: C001-C005 describe background synthesis and temporal associations. Later claims characterize genetic ancestries, contact patterns, and population dynamics. These are discoveries/characterizations rather than hypothesis confirmations. However, RD007 (pathogen screening) is a clear hypothesis test with null result.",
      "methods_application": "Methods follow systematic analysis workflow: sampling (M001), data generation (M002-M004), chronological framework (M003), then multiple analytical approaches (M005-M016). The triangulation design (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm) suggests exploratory characterization rather than confirmatory testing of pre-specified hypotheses.",
      "analytical_workflow": "Workflow is exploratory within structured framework: characterize ancestries using cornerstone populations, detect genetic structure, model admixture events. The paper discovers that Cernavodă I individuals show steppe ancestry earlier than previously documented - this is a discovery, not a hypothesis confirmation."

    "mismatch_explanation": "Paper expresses research as addressing a knowledge gap (deductive framing) but revealed approach is predominantly inductive/exploratory characterization of ancient DNA patterns. The pathogen screening (RD007) is genuinely deductive with null result. This is legitimately mixed-method research - the framing emphasizes hypothesis-driven aspects but actual analysis is largely exploratory. No HARKing detected - findings are presented as discoveries consistent with exploratory approach."

The core contribution is characterizing genetic ancestries and discovering contact patterns - these are exploratory findings rather than hypothesis confirmations. Methods (PCA, ancestry modelling) are pattern-detection tools. The discovery that Cernavodă I individuals show steppe ancestry is a novel finding, not confirmation of pre-specified prediction. Classification as inductive with acknowledgement of mixed elements."

Robustness deemphasised as exploratory studies may not exhaustively test alternatives. Note: deductive element (RD007) can be assessed with confirmatory criteria within overall inductive framework."

  "classification_notes": "High-profile Nature archaeogenetics paper. Mixed approach with predominantly inductive ancestry characterization and secondary deductive element (pathogen hypothesis test with null result). Classification as inductive reflects the core contribution: discovering and characterizing genetic contact patterns. The systematic triangulation design (RD006) provides robustness to inductive findings. Excellent data sharing (ENA, AADR) but no code repository."
