## Cluster Summaries

### Cluster 1: Foundational Clarity (Transparency Pillar)

**Rating:** Strong

This cluster assesses whether the work is documented and understandable. The paper demonstrates excellent comprehensibility with clear research goals, well-defined terminology (cornerstone populations), and systematic progression from observations to patterns. Transparency is good with exemplary data archiving (ENA) but no code repository.

| Signal | Score | Band |
|--------|-------|------|
| Comprehensibility | 85 | Excellent |
| Transparency | 78 | Good |

**Key Strengths:**
- Research goals explicitly stated (knowledge gap between 4250-3300 BC)
- Key terms defined (cornerstone populations, ancestry components)
- 35 protocols document analytical procedures

**Key Weaknesses:**
- No code repository despite computational analysis
- Cornerstone population selection rationale implicit

---

### Cluster 2: Evidential Strength (Credibility Pillar)

**Rating:** Strong

This cluster addresses the core question: How much faith can we put in the results? The paper demonstrates strong evidential strength with excellent validity (large sample, systematic sampling) and plausibility (findings consistent with frameworks). Robustness benefits from methodological triangulation.

| Signal | Score | Band |
|--------|-------|------|
| Plausibility | 82 | Excellent |
| Validity | 84 | Excellent |
| Robustness | 76 | Good |
| Generalisability | 74 | Good |

**Key Strengths:**
- 135 individuals with genome-wide data, 113 radiocarbon dated
- Methodological triangulation (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, ROH)
- Patterns consistent with established frameworks

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Limited systematic sensitivity analysis
- Scope constraints informal rather than systematic

---

### Cluster 3: Reproducibility (Reproducibility Pillar)

**Rating:** Adequate

This cluster assesses whether computational aspects can be re-executed. The paper demonstrates adequate reproducibility with excellent data availability but missing code sharing.

| Signal | Score | Band | Pathway |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Reproducibility | 72 | Good | Standard |

**Key Strengths:**
- DNA sequences deposited in ENA (PRJEB62503)
- FAIR score 81% (13/16)
- Standard tools identified (ADMIXTOOLS, EIGENSOFT)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- No code repository
- Custom analysis scripts not shared
- Exact reproduction requires author contact

**Execution Feasibility:** Needs Work — Data available but code gap limits exact reproduction

---

## Era Context

**Publication Year:** 2023  
**Era:** Current (2020-present)  
**Era Label:** Current era — FAIR and open science expectations established

**Interpretation:** Published in Nature in 2023, this paper is assessed against contemporary open science expectations. The excellent data archiving (ENA) meets current best practice for archaeogenetics. The absence of a code repository reflects ongoing transition in the field — data sharing is standard but code sharing is not yet universal. For a 2023 Nature paper, the data sharing is exemplary but code sharing falls short of emerging best practice.

## Infrastructure & FAIR Summary

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **FAIR Score** | 13/16 (81%) | Highly FAIR |
| **FAIR Rating** | Highly FAIR | Strong across all dimensions |
| **Code Availability** | Not Available | No repository; software tools listed |
| **Data Availability** | Available | ENA PRJEB62503, open access |
| **Preregistration** | Not Applicable | Exploratory research |
| **PID Coverage** | Good | Paper DOI, ENA accession |

**Infrastructure Gaps:**
- Code repository for analysis scripts should be created
- Consider Zenodo deposit for supplementary materials with DOI
- Author ORCIDs should be more prominently displayed

## Detailed Findings

### Comprehensibility (85, Excellent)

The paper demonstrates excellent comprehensibility for inductive archaeogenetics research. The research goal is explicitly stated: address the knowledge gap about genetic events between Copper Age demise (4250 BC) and pastoralist expansion (3300 BC). Pattern descriptions are clear, using established terminology (cornerstone populations, ancestry components). The 84 claims are systematically structured from background through findings to implications. Nature editorial standards ensure high clarity.

### Transparency (78, Good)

Research design and methods are comprehensively documented across 35 protocols. Data archiving is exemplary: DNA sequences in ENA with open access and high machine actionability. However, no code repository exists — a notable gap for computational research. The gap between excellent data sharing and absent code sharing reflects archaeogenetics field norms where sequence deposit is standard but script sharing is less consistent.

### Plausibility (82, Excellent)

Findings are highly consistent with established frameworks. Neolithic Anatolian farmer ancestry in southeastern European Copper Age groups aligns with known population dynamics. Steppe-associated ancestry appearing by Eneolithic period fits archaeological evidence for contact. The null result for pathogens (RD007) is honestly reported. Discovery of earlier-than-expected steppe ancestry is presented as requiring explanation, not suppressed.

### Validity (84, Excellent)

The paper's core strength is evidential quality. 135 ancient individuals with genome-wide data and 113 direct radiocarbon dates provide robust foundation. Sampling strategy targets archaeologically significant sites (Yunatsite, Varna, Pietrele). Methodological triangulation (RD006) using multiple complementary approaches strengthens ancestry characterisations. Claims are appropriately scoped to evidence.

### Robustness (76, Good)

Methodological triangulation provides internal robustness — main patterns are consistent across PCA, f-statistics, and qpAdm modelling. Failed qpAdm models are acknowledged and alternatives attempted. However, systematic sensitivity analysis is limited. Cornerstone population selection lacks explicit rationale, and sensitivity to reference panel composition is not documented.

### Generalisability (74, Good)

Claims are explicitly bounded by geography (southeastern Europe to northwestern Black Sea) and chronology (5400-2400 BC). Sampling limitations are acknowledged. Extrapolations are appropriately qualified. However, transfer conditions could be more systematically specified — the paper could more clearly define what conditions would need to hold for findings to apply elsewhere.

### Reproducibility (72, Good)

Data availability is excellent: ENA deposit enables complete data-level reproduction. Workflow is documented through 35 protocols with identified software tools. However, the absence of a code repository is the key gap — exact computational reproduction would require recreating analysis scripts or contacting authors. For a 2023 paper with extensive computational analysis, code sharing would be expected.
