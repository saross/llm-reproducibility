## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 82/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** Inductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates excellent plausibility for inductive archaeogenetics research. Observed patterns are highly consistent with established regional chronological frameworks. The characterization of genetic ancestries fits known population dynamics: Neolithic Anatolian farmer ancestry in southeastern European Copper Age groups is well-established; steppe-associated ancestry appearing by the Eneolithic period aligns with archaeological evidence for contact.

The paper grounds interpretations in comprehensive comparative data using the Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR) reference panel. Pattern classifications follow established archaeogenetic conventions: PCA clustering, f-statistics, qpAdm ancestry modelling.

Anomalies are acknowledged and contextualised. The null result for pathogens (RD007) is honestly reported despite failing to confirm disease hypothesis for settlement abandonment. The discovery of earlier-than-expected steppe ancestry in Cernavodă I individuals is presented as a notable finding requiring explanation, not suppressed.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- Patterns consistent with known regional frameworks (Neolithic ancestry in CA groups)
- Comparative basis via AADR reference panel
- RD007: Null pathogen result honestly reported
- Discovery of early steppe ancestry acknowledged as requiring explanation

**Weaknesses:**
- Some interpretations rely on limited number of individuals (e.g., specific burial contexts)

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 82 (Excellent) reflects: observed patterns consistent with known regional/chronological frameworks (80-100); typologies follow established conventions (f-statistics, qpAdm); anomalies acknowledged and contextualised (pathogen null result); interpretations grounded in comparative data (AADR).

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 84/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** Inductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates excellent validity for pattern-finding research. Data sufficiency is outstanding: 135 ancient individuals with genome-wide data, 113 with direct radiocarbon dates. This sample size is substantial for ancient DNA studies and enables robust pattern detection.

Sampling is systematic and appropriate. RD002 explicitly defines spatiotemporal scope (southeastern Europe to northwestern Black Sea, 5400-2400 BC) with strategic focus on archaeologically significant sites (Yunatsite, Varna, Pietrele, Petko Karavelovo). Coverage is adequate for the research question, though necessarily incomplete for the full geographic region.

Methods are appropriate for pattern claims. The methodological triangulation design (RD006) uses multiple complementary approaches: PCA for visualization, f-statistics for formal ancestry testing, qpAdm for admixture modelling, ROH analysis for demographic inference. This multi-method approach strengthens validity of ancestry characterizations.

Alternative interpretations are considered. The paper discusses multiple potential explanations for genetic patterns and avoids overinterpretation of limited samples.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- 135 individuals with genome-wide data - substantial sample
- 113 direct radiocarbon dates - robust chronological framework
- RD006: Methodological triangulation with multiple analytical approaches
- Strategic site selection (RD005) targeting archaeologically significant contexts

**Weaknesses:**
- Coverage necessarily incomplete for full geographic scope
- Some genetic clusters based on small numbers of individuals

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 84 (Excellent) reflects: data sufficient and representative for pattern claims (80-100); sampling systematic and appropriate (80-100); coverage adequate for research question; alternative interpretations considered; sampling limitations acknowledged; claims scoped to evidence.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 76/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** Inductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good robustness through methodological triangulation. Multiple analytical methods are used for pattern identification: PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm modelling, runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis. Main patterns (e.g., Copper Age farmer ancestry, steppe contact) are consistent across these different analytical approaches.

The triangulation design (RD006) provides internal robustness. The paper tests for excess shared ancestry using "four Holocene 'cornerstone' populations" and applies multiple f-statistic tests. Where qpAdm models fail to fit, this is reported and alternative models are tried.

However, some limitations exist. Inter-observer reliability for genetic pattern interpretation is not explicitly assessed (though largely method-defined in this field). The cornerstone population selection (RD008) lacks explicit rationale, meaning results could be sensitive to this choice. Sensitivity to other analytical choices (e.g., SNP filtering thresholds, reference panel composition) is not systematically documented.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- RD006: Multiple complementary methods (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, ROH)
- Main patterns consistent across analytical approaches
- Failed qpAdm models acknowledged and alternatives attempted
- Convergent evidence from multiple genetic indicators

**Weaknesses:**
- Cornerstone population selection rationale implicit (RD008)
- Sensitivity to reference panel composition not systematically tested
- No explicit inter-observer reliability (standard for field)

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 76 (Good) reflects: pattern identification tested with multiple methods (60-79); main patterns robust to variations; some alternatives explored; sampling sensitivity considered implicitly. Gap from Excellent due to limited systematic sensitivity testing and implicit cornerstone selection rationale.

---

## Signal 6: Generalisability

**Score:** 74/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** Inductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good scope constraint with appropriate limitations. Pattern claims are explicitly bounded by geography (southeastern Europe to northwestern Black Sea) and chronology (5400-2400 BC). The paper does not overextend findings beyond the sampled region and time period.

Sampling limitations are acknowledged. The paper explicitly notes that coverage is limited to available skeletal material from accessible archaeological sites. The focus on "emblematic sites" (RD005) means findings reflect major cultural centres rather than complete regional representation.

Extrapolations are appropriately qualified. Interpretations about contact between farming and pastoralist groups are presented as patterns within the sampled context, not universal claims about prehistoric demography. The paper discusses regional specificity and avoids sweeping claims about "European" or "global" patterns.

However, explicit discussion of transfer conditions is limited. The paper could more clearly specify what conditions would need to hold for findings to apply to other regions or time periods.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- Geographic and temporal bounds explicit (RD002)
- Sampling limitations acknowledged
- Focus on specific sites rather than universal claims
- Extrapolations appropriately qualified

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited explicit discussion of transfer conditions
- Regional/contextual constraints could be more systematic

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 74 (Good) reflects: pattern claims bounded (60-79); sampling limitations acknowledged; scope matched to coverage; extrapolations qualified. Gap from Excellent due to informal rather than systematic constraint specification.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Strong

This Nature archaeogenetics paper demonstrates strong evidential strength across all four signals, with scores ranging from 74-84 (Good to Excellent). The overall pattern reflects high-quality exploratory research with rigorous methodology and appropriate constraint.

The highest scores (Validity 84, Plausibility 82) reflect the paper's core strengths: substantial sample size, systematic sampling strategy, and findings consistent with established frameworks. The methodological triangulation design provides robust pattern identification.

Lower scores (Robustness 76, Generalisability 74) reflect common exploratory research patterns: implicit rather than explicit sensitivity testing, and informal rather than systematic scope constraint. These are not weaknesses per se, but represent areas where current practice falls short of comprehensive assessment standards.

### Pattern Summary

The dominant pattern is rigorous exploratory research with methodological triangulation providing internal robustness. The paper exemplifies Nature-quality archaeogenetics: large samples, multiple methods, appropriate interpretation. Main credibility gaps are common to the field rather than paper-specific: implicit analytical choices, limited systematic sensitivity analysis.

### Implications for Cluster 3

- **For Reproducibility:** Excellent data archiving (ENA) enables data-level reproduction. Methodological detail (35 protocols) supports analytical reproduction with appropriate software. Code gap limits exact computational workflow reproduction.
