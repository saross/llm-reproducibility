    "abstract": "FAIMS Mobile is a native Android application supported by an Ubuntu server facilitating human-mediated field research across disciplines. It consists of 'core' Java and Ruby software providing a platform for data capture, which can be deeply customised using 'definition packets' consisting of XML documents (data schema and UI) and Beanshell scripts (automation). Definition packets can also be generated using an XML-based domain-specific language, making customisation easier. FAIMS Mobile includes features allowing rich and efficient data capture tailored to the needs of fieldwork. It also promotes synthetic research and improves transparency and reproducibility through the production of comprehensive datasets that can be mapped to vocabularies or ontologies as they are created."

Field data is often collected using an ad-hoc mix of hard copy, data fragments in various formats, and bespoke databases [2–5]. Datasets, furthermore, are often trapped in hard-copy archives, local storage, or digital 'silos', making them difficult to discover and limiting reinterpretation and reuse [6]. Digital datasets are often highly variable, of poor quality, and incompatible. Deficiencies like these inhibit reuse of primary data and the aggregation of datasets from multiple studies for large-scale research [4,7,1].",

Researchers reported more complete, consistent, and granular data. They noted that information could be exchanged more quickly between excavators and specialists, which in one case improved 'post-excavation reconstruction of the site' and facilitated the evaluation of patterns for meaning in another.",

ACCESSIBLE (10/10): All code publicly available on GitHub, licensed under GPLv3 (open licence), available via Google Play for end users, comprehensive user-to-developer documentation publicly accessible, no registration barriers. INTEROPERABLE (8/10): Open-source Java/Ruby stack with documented APIs, XML-based domain-specific language, customisable export to multiple standard formats (shapefiles, CSV, XML, GeoJSON), supports integration with standard repositories (e.g., Open Context). Minor limitations: some custom components (definition packets) require FAIMS-specific knowledge; full interoperability requires understanding proprietary architecture. REUSABLE (8/10): GPLv3 licence clearly specified, extensive documentation (User to Developer guide), library of reusable modules on GitHub, active community development model, customisation services available. Minor limitations: steep learning curve for customisation (XML, Beanshell, CSS required), dependency on specific technology stack (Android, Ubuntu server), independent deployment requires technical expertise. OVERALL: Strong FAIR compliance for research software - transparent, accessible, and reusable with good documentation and active community."
