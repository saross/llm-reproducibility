The primary contribution is the software itself and its architecture, not empirical findings. Claims describe software capabilities, design decisions, and deployment impact.

(3) Reproducibility - can others use/extend software? Robustness deemphasised as advocacy papers argue for position rather than testing alternatives. Generalisability less central as software applicability is domain-specific by design."
