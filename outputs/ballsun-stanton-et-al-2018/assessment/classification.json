  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is FAIMS Mobile software platform for field data collection. Paper presents tool capabilities, technical architecture (Android app + Ubuntu server), design decisions, and deployment experience. Claims are about software properties ('FAIMS Mobile includes features allowing rich and efficient data capture', 'designed for offline use', 'more customisable than ODK'). 'Results' section describes software features and architecture, not substantive research findings. Three archaeological case studies are referenced but serve demonstrative function (showing what tool can do), not as primary contribution. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a paper USING a method to study phenomena.",

No hypothesis-testing of software performance. No systematic benchmark comparison with alternatives (ODK comparison is qualitative positioning, not performance benchmarking). Validation is purely descriptive/demonstrative: describes what tool does, shows examples of deployment. 'Impact' section provides adoption statistics and qualitative case study findings, not controlled evaluation."

FAIMS validation is inductive/descriptive: (1) Software capabilities described systematically, (2) Features demonstrated through three archaeological case studies from Sobotkova et al. 2016, (3) Impact assessed through adoption statistics and qualitative deployment experience, (4) No deductive hypothesis-testing of tool performance, (5) No abductive inference about design alternatives. Primary contribution is technical specification with demonstrative validation. Confidence high because validation strategy is clear, consistent, and appropriate for software tool paper in SoftwareX journal."

Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the software (does it actually do what claimed?). Generalisability and Robustness of case studies deemphasised - case studies are illustrative demonstrations, not meant to generalise beyond showing tool capabilities."

  "classification_notes": "Straightforward methodological paper (software tool) with inductive validation approach. Classification matches expected outcome (methodological/software_tool). Paper appropriately presents software through description and demonstration rather than hypothesis-testing. Note: extraction has minor schema variations (verbatim_quote instead of claim_text) but content sufficient for classification. SoftwareX journal context appropriate for this paper type."
