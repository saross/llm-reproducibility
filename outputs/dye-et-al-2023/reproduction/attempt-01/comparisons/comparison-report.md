### Qualitative Results

#### Occurrence Plot (Paper Figure 7)

- 72 interments confirmed
- Spans approximately 415-777 CE (5th-8th century)
- Continuous distribution without gaps
- Consistent with published figure description

#### Tempo Plots (Paper Figure 8)

- 23 bead types plotted (after melon consolidation + WhSpiral addition)
- Two distinct shape patterns visible:
  - Early rise/level off (long-lived types like BE3-Amber)
  - Late start/quick rise (late-appearing types like BE1-Disc)
- Layout and style match supplement description

### Methodology

1. **Environment:** Docker container (rocker/r-ver:4.3.1) with ArchaeoPhases
   v1.8 from CRAN
2. **Data:** Single MCMC run (beads-1.csv, 6000 samples) from author's server
3. **Analysis:** Deterministic post-processing — no stochastic elements after
   MCMC generation
4. **Comparison:** All 54 Allen algebra probability values compared against
   supplement Tables 2-10

### Why Exact Matches Are Expected

The analysis is fully deterministic: given fixed MCMC samples, the Allen
algebra frequency calculations produce identical results regardless of R
version or platform. The MCMC samples are counts/proportions over 6000 fixed
draws, rounded to 2 decimal places. Unlike the Crema reproduction (which
regenerated MCMC samples), there is no stochastic element in the
post-processing step.

### Scope Limitation (OxCal)

The upstream OxCal 4.4.2 MCMC generation step is proprietary and was not
reproduced. This is documented rather than treated as a reproduction failure
because:

- The paper's contribution is the ArchaeoPhases methodology (Allen's interval
  algebra for archaeological chronology), not the OxCal modelling
- The authors provided their MCMC output for verification
- This is analogous to Phase 1 of the Crema reproduction (using pre-computed
  posteriors)
- The five-run replicability analysis (Supplement Section 3, Table 1)
  demonstrates that OxCal results are stable across runs (mean variability
  1.3 ± 1.7 years, median 1 year)

### Verdict Justification

**SUCCESSFUL** — All 54 quantitative values match exactly. Occurrence plot
shows 72 interments in the expected range. Tempo plots for all 23 bead types
generated. All three Allen algebra analyses (stable solid branching, monochrome
branching, BE1-Dghnt reticulation) produced correct results. The OxCal
limitation is documented but does not affect the reproduction of the paper's
analytical contribution.
