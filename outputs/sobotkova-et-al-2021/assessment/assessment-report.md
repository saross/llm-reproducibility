#### Evidence Consolidations

**E031 - Phase Aggregation (Exemplary)**:
Consolidated four temporal periods (1990s requirements → 2000s ARCPad → early 2010s iOS → past 5 years combinations) into single historical progression. Preserves all milestones whilst avoiding fragmentation. Assessment would evaluate as single technology evolution narrative.

**E069 - Major Consolidation**:
Combined three measurement types (usage hours, record counts, value counts) from same field deployment. Preserves all quantitative details whilst avoiding over-splitting into separate performance metrics.

**P011/P012 - Workflow Consolidations**:
Comprehensive feature recording (P011, 13 steps) and gridded survey (P012, 10 steps) workflows consolidated from legacy protocols P001/P002. Exemplary decision avoiding protocol fragmentation whilst maintaining complete operational detail.

#### Appropriate Atomicity Examples

**E050/E053**: Feature estimates separate from survey estimates - Correct (different workflows)
**E067/E068**: Module adaptation times separate - Correct (different modules)
**C004/C005**: Hardware requirements separate from offline benefits - Correct (distinct capabilities)
