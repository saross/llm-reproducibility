# Pass B: Granularity Assessment - sobotkova-et-al-2021

## Assessment Overview

**Total Items:** 169 (66 evidence, 73 claims, 8 methods, 20 protocols, 2 designs)
**Assessment Date:** 2025-11-02
**Assessor:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Methodology

Assess whether items are:
1. **Appropriately atomic**: Each item represents single coherent unit of information
2. **Not over-split**: Related information not unnecessarily fragmented
3. **Not under-split**: Complex compound statements not combined inappropriately
4. **Consistently scoped**: Similar types of information treated with similar granularity
5. **Functionally useful**: Granularity supports assessment and replication needs

## Assessment by Item Type

### Evidence Items (66 total)

**Granularity Analysis**:

**Excellent consolidation decisions** (16 consolidated items):
- **E013**: Idiosyncratic organisation + multi-generational data appropriately combined
- **E022**: Project structure + scope combined (profile consolidation)
- **E027**: Disputed significance + unmapped extent (single research gap)
- **E029**: Three methods + recording scope (methodological choice)
- **E031**: Four-decade technology evolution (phase aggregation) - Exemplary temporal consolidation
- **E035**: Bespoke solutions + Esri ecosystem (technology landscape)
- **E043**: Consistency-serendipity tension + emergent structures (compound finding)
- **E046**: TRAP precedent + workflow description (complete methodology)
- **E048**: Data heterogeneity + feature range (technical requirement)
- **E057**: Bulgaria deployment + optimization focus (historical precedent)
- **E064**: Unique IDs + human-readable IDs (system capability)
- **E069**: Usage hours + records + values (quantitative outcome) - Major consolidation
- **E074**: Performance degradation + recovery (performance outcome)
- **E076**: Daily export + decision-making use (workflow outcome)
- **E082**: Performance + data quality comparison (comparative outcome)

- E050/E053: Feature estimates vs survey estimates - Correctly separated
- E067/E068: Feature module time vs Survey module time - Correctly separated

**No over-splitting detected**: Related information consistently consolidated

**No under-splitting detected**: No inappropriately combined distinct findings

**Granularity Score**: 66/66 appropriate = 100.0%

**No over-splitting detected**: All claim separations justified

**No under-splitting detected**: No inappropriately combined claims

**Consistency check**: Similar types of claims treated with consistent granularity:
- Requirements claims (C029-C036): All separate - Consistent
- Technical capability claims (C044-C052): All separate - Consistent
- Performance claims (C056-C060): All separate - Consistent

**Granularity Score**: 73/73 appropriate = 100.0%

- Quality methods (M005): Consolidated multiple quality approaches - Appropriate consolidation

**No over-splitting**: Related quality assurance approaches consolidated in M005

**No under-splitting**: M002 covers both workflows appropriately as single deployment method

**Granularity Score**: 8/8 appropriate = 100.0%

### Protocols Items (20 total)

**Granularity Analysis**:

**Explicit protocols (13 total)**:
- P003: Bi-directional sync - Appropriate technical scope

### Research Designs Items (2 total)

**Granularity Analysis**:

- Scope: Project-level evaluation design
- Appropriately abstract: Captures overall evaluation approach

**RD002**: Platform deployment and customization design

Two research designs represent distinct design dimensions:
- RD001: Evaluation design (how to assess FAIMS)
- RD002: Implementation design (how to deploy/customize FAIMS)

Not over-split (could be single design) but separation defensible based on distinct design purposes.

**Granularity Score**: 2/2 appropriate = 100.0%

- Performance metrics: Uniformly separate (E050, E053, E067, E068, E071, E073)
- Workflow protocols: Comprehensive but not fragmented (P011, P012)

### Functional Appropriateness
Granularity consistently supports:
- Transparency assessment (detailed protocols)

- Evidence-claim mapping (atomic evidence items)
- RDMAP hierarchy clarity (distinct design-method-protocol levels)

### No Granularity Issues
- Zero over-splitting instances
- Zero under-splitting instances
- Zero inconsistencies within item types
- All consolidations preserve complete information

## Notable Examples

### Excellent Consolidations
1. **E031** (Phase aggregation): Four temporal periods consolidated into single historical progression
2. **E069** (Compound metrics): Usage hours + records + values consolidated appropriately
3. **P011** (Comprehensive workflow): 13-step feature recording protocol consolidated from P001

### Appropriate Atomicity
1. **E050/E053**: Feature vs survey estimates correctly separate
2. **E067/E068**: Module adaptation times correctly separate
3. **C004/C005**: Hardware requirements vs offline benefits correctly separate

## Recommendations

Granularity execution is exemplary. No adjustments required. Extraction demonstrates strong editorial judgment balancing atomic principle with functional usefulness.
