  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper advocates for preregistration as a methodological practice in archaeology. The primary contribution is a theoretical framework and practical recommendations for adopting preregistration, not empirical findings about archaeological phenomena. Claims are about methodology (how research should be conducted), not about substantive archaeological questions. Research designs are explicitly 'argumentative_synthesis', 'comparative_analysis', and 'historical_analysis' - all focused on building a case FOR a methodological practice. The paper does not present new software, analytical techniques, or field protocols; instead, it argues for the adoption of an existing practice (preregistration) from other disciplines.",

    "subtype": "theoretical_framework",
    "validation_approach": "abductive",
    "validation_notes": "The paper builds an argument through inference to best explanation. It: (1) documents problems in current archaeological practice (just-in-time methodology, lack of transparency, reproducibility concerns), (2) analyses how other disciplines have addressed similar problems (biomedicine, psychology, ecology), (3) examines historical evolution of archaeological planning, (4) presents preregistration as the 'best explanation' for how to address these issues in archaeology. No hypothesis-testing of preregistration effectiveness; no inductive pattern discovery. Validation is through theoretical coherence and analogical reasoning from other fields."

    "fit_notes": "Classified as 'methodological' because primary contribution is a methodological practice/framework. However, this is an advocacy/argumentative paper rather than presenting a specific tool or technique. Fits 'theoretical_framework' subtype reasonably well. Could also be considered 'theoretical/review' but methodological is closer because the subject matter is research methodology itself."

      "Paper does not explicitly state a research methodology or epistemological framework",

    "significance": "Methodological advocacy papers rarely state explicit research approaches because they are building arguments, not conducting empirical research. The absence of stated approach is appropriate for this paper type - it would be unusual for an advocacy paper to declare itself 'abductive' or 'inductive'."

      "claims_structure": "Claims follow abductive pattern: identify problem (reproducibility crisis, QRPs, just-in-time archaeology) → evaluate alternative solutions (implicit) → argue preregistration is best explanation/solution. Mix of methodological claims ('preregistration encourages thoughtfulness'), evaluative claims ('under-planned fieldwork is likely to result in biased conclusions'), and empirical background claims ('archaeology unlikely to avoid reproducibility crisis'). Claims build toward inference to best practice.",
      "methods_application": "RD001 explicitly describes 'argumentative synthesis' design. Methods are comparative analysis across disciplines (RD002) and historical analysis of archaeological planning (RD003). These methods support abductive inference by providing evidence base for 'best explanation' argument.",
      "analytical_workflow": "Problem identification (what's wrong with current practice) → cross-disciplinary analysis (how have others solved this) → historical context (how did we get here) → solution proposal (preregistration as best response) → practical guidance (how to implement). This is classic abductive reasoning: inference to best explanation for methodological reform."

This is appropriate for methodological advocacy papers - they build arguments rather than test hypotheses or discover patterns. Classification based entirely on revealed approach (abductive inference to best practice). No HARKing concern because paper does not claim to test predictions - it explicitly builds an argument."

The paper: (1) Identifies puzzles/problems in archaeological practice (just-in-time methodology, lack of transparency, reproducibility concerns), (2) Examines how other fields have addressed similar issues, (3) Proposes preregistration as the best explanation/solution for archaeology's methodological challenges. It does not test hypotheses (not deductive) or inductively discover patterns from data. The argumentative structure is explicitly building a case that preregistration is the best available response to identified problems. For a methodological paper, this abductive validation approach means the framework is justified through theoretical coherence, analogical reasoning, and explanatory adequacy rather than empirical testing."

The ABSENCE of formal methodology is appropriate for advocacy papers and does not indicate weakness - the paper is transparent about its argumentative purpose ('This paper introduces...', 'We argue that...'). Transparency is moderate rather than high because the epistemological stance (abductive reasoning) is implicit rather than stated."

(2) Comprehensibility - is the argument structure clear and the case well-articulated? (3) Transparency - are premises, evidence sources, and reasoning steps explicit? Secondary: Validity (evidence adequacy for claims), Generalisability (appropriate scope of recommendations). Deemphasised: Robustness (not sensitivity analysis - but alternative arguments should be considered), Reproducibility (no computational component - but methodological transparency variant may apply for reasoning traceability)."

  "classification_notes": "This is a methodological advocacy paper using abductive reasoning to argue for preregistration adoption in archaeology. It's not empirical research, not software/tool presentation, and not pure literature review. The classification as 'methodological' with 'abductive' validation approach captures its argumentative character. Key credibility questions: Is the argument well-constructed? Are premises sound? Is preregistration genuinely the 'best explanation' for addressing the identified problems? The paper should be assessed on argument quality, not empirical validity."
