## Paper Type: Methodological

This paper advocates for preregistration as a methodological practice in archaeology. The primary contribution is a theoretical framework and practical recommendations, not empirical findings about archaeological phenomena.

**Research Designs Identified:**
- RD001: Argumentative synthesis
- RD002: Comparative analysis (cross-disciplinary)
- RD003: Historical analysis

## Classification: Abductive

**Revealed Approach:** Abductive (inference to best explanation)

The paper builds an argument through:
1. **Problem identification** — documents issues with current practice (just-in-time archaeology, reproducibility concerns)
2. **Cross-disciplinary analysis** — examines how biomedicine, psychology, ecology addressed similar problems
3. **Historical context** — traces evolution of archaeological planning from 1970s processual ideals
4. **Solution proposal** — presents preregistration as best response to identified problems
5. **Practical guidance** — provides implementation recommendations

This is classic abductive reasoning: **inference to best practice/explanation**.

## Expressed vs Revealed

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Expressed Approach | none_stated |
| Revealed Approach | abductive |
| Alignment | partial (disciplinary convention) |
| HARKing Flag | false |

**Note:** Advocacy papers rarely state explicit research approaches. The absence is appropriate for this paper type.

## Credibility Framework

**Framework:** abductive_emphasis

**Primary Signals:**
1. Plausibility — Does argument cohere with domain knowledge?
2. Comprehensibility — Is argument structure clear?
3. Transparency — Are premises and reasoning explicit?

**Secondary Signals:**
- Validity — Evidence adequacy for claims
- Generalisability — Appropriate scope of recommendations

**Deemphasised:**
- Robustness — Not sensitivity analysis (but alternatives should be considered)
- Reproducibility — No computational component

---

## Key Credibility Questions

For this argumentative paper, assessment should focus on:

1. Is the argument well-constructed and logically coherent?
2. Are the premises (problems with current practice) sound and documented?
3. Is preregistration genuinely the "best explanation" for addressing identified problems?
4. Are alternative approaches to transparency adequately considered?
5. Is the scope of recommendations appropriately constrained?

## Taxonomy Fit

**Category Fit Quality:** Acceptable

The paper fits "methodological" category reasonably well as an advocacy paper for a methodological practice. Could also be considered "theoretical/review" but methodological is closer because the subject matter is research methodology itself.
