## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** Abductive

### Assessment

The proposed explanation — that preregistration is the best solution for addressing reproducibility and transparency challenges in archaeology — is highly coherent with established domain knowledge. The argument is grounded in extensive cross-disciplinary evidence and builds on longstanding concerns within archaeology itself.

The theoretical framework is robust and well-grounded. The paper correctly identifies the reproducibility crisis as documented across multiple disciplines (E001, E002), demonstrating that the problem is real and widespread. The historical analysis traces similar concerns in archaeology back to the 1970s (E005, E006, E007), establishing continuity with disciplinary traditions.

Alternative explanations are properly, if not exhaustively, evaluated. The paper addresses potential concerns about preregistration stifling exploratory research (C003_consolidated addresses this), acknowledges that not all projects benefit equally (C006 notes variation), and discusses the predictive/postdictive distinction to explain when preregistration applies. The framework accommodates methodological diversity.

The inference does not require ad hoc assumptions. The core logic — that practices proven effective in other disciplines can transfer to archaeology given appropriate adaptation — is reasonable and grounded in established theory of scientific reform.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- E001-E002: Cross-disciplinary evidence of reproducibility crisis provides strong grounding
- E005-E008: Historical evidence shows archaeology has recognised these issues for decades
- M001: Conceptual framework (predictive/postdictive) grounded in established epistemology
- RD002: Comparative analysis explicitly examines how other disciplines addressed similar problems
- C003_consolidated: Explicitly addresses methodological diversity accommodation

**Weaknesses:**
- Alternative approaches to transparency (e.g., registered reports, data sharing mandates, statistical reforms) not systematically compared
- Assumption that disciplinary transfer is straightforward could be examined more critically

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 80 (Excellent for abductive research). Meets 80-100 criteria: "Proposed explanation coherent with domain knowledge; alternative explanations properly evaluated; inference grounded in established theory; framework robust; no ad hoc assumptions." The argument is well-grounded in cross-disciplinary evidence and archaeological history, alternatives are considered (though not exhaustively), and the inference requires no implausible assumptions. At the lower end of Excellent because alternative transparency approaches aren't systematically compared.

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 72/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** Abductive

### Assessment

For an abductive methodological argument, validity assesses whether evidence supports the proposed explanation and whether alternatives are adequately considered. This paper performs well, though with notable limitations.

Evidence supports the core explanation. The paper provides: (1) quantitative evidence of questionable research practices in comparable fields (E002: 51% HARKing rate), (2) documented success of preregistration in biomedicine and psychology (E003, E004), (3) historical evidence of planning concerns in archaeology (E005-E007). This convergent evidence supports the inference that preregistration could address identified problems.

The inference from other disciplines to archaeology is reasonable but involves assumptions about transferability that receive less scrutiny than they might. The paper assumes that practices successful in hypothesis-testing contexts (biomedicine, psychology) will transfer to a more methodologically diverse discipline. This is plausible but not rigorously defended.

Gaps are acknowledged to some extent. The paper notes that "many, but by no means all, archaeological projects could benefit from preregistration" (RD001), and discusses limitations of the approach. However, the evidence-to-conclusion gap (from "preregistration works elsewhere" to "preregistration will work in archaeology") involves assumptions that could be more explicitly examined.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- E002: Quantitative evidence (51% HARKing) provides concrete basis for claims about research practice problems
- E003-E004: Evidence of established preregistration infrastructure demonstrates feasibility
- RD003-RD004: Historical and empirical analyses provide archaeological-specific grounding
- Multiple evidence types (cross-disciplinary, historical, survey) support triangulation

**Weaknesses:**
- Evidence from other disciplines may not directly apply to archaeology's unique context
- RD004 examines existing OSF preregistrations but findings not extensively reported in claims
- Gap between evidence (practices work elsewhere) and conclusion (practices will work here) involves untested assumptions

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 72 (Good for abductive research). Meets 60-79 criteria: "Evidence supports explanation; alternatives considered; inference grounded; some rivals addressed; gaps acknowledged; scope appropriate." Evidence from multiple sources supports the explanation, the inference is grounded, and scope is appropriate. Falls short of Excellent because the disciplinary transfer inference could be more rigorously defended, and some evidence (RD004 survey) is mentioned but not fully integrated.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 58/100 (Moderate)

**Approach anchors applied:** Abductive

### Assessment

For abductive arguments, robustness assesses whether the inference is stable across different frameworks and whether alternative explanations have been rigorously tested. This is the paper's weakest area.

Alternative explanations receive limited systematic testing. While the paper acknowledges some alternatives (e.g., that preregistration might stifle exploration), it does not rigorously test whether other transparency mechanisms might achieve similar benefits. The argument assumes preregistration is the best explanation rather than demonstrating it through comparison.

Framework sensitivity is not extensively documented. The inference relies heavily on the assumption that disciplinary transfer is straightforward, but the paper doesn't explore how conclusions might change under different assumptions about archaeology's methodological distinctiveness.

Some triangulation is present. The convergence of evidence from multiple disciplines and the historical analysis of archaeological practice provide some triangulation. The conceptual framework (M001: predictive/postdictive distinction) offers theoretical grounding. But systematic sensitivity analysis is absent.

The robustness score reflects the argumentative nature of the paper. Methodological advocacy papers rarely include the kind of sensitivity analysis expected in empirical research. For this paper type, a Moderate score is not a severe criticism but indicates that readers should consider alternative approaches.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- RD001-RD005: Multiple analytical approaches (comparative, historical, empirical) provide some triangulation
- M001: Conceptual framework provides theoretical grounding
- Evidence from multiple disciplines (psychology, biomedicine, ecology) offers convergent support

**Weaknesses:**
- No systematic comparison of preregistration to alternative transparency mechanisms (e.g., registered reports, mandatory data sharing, statistical reforms)
- Framework sensitivity not explored — would conclusions change if disciplinary transfer assumptions are questioned?
- Single best-explanation framework; alternatives not rigorously ruled out

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 58 (Moderate for abductive research). Meets 40-59 criteria: "Limited alternatives; robustness unclear; minimal triangulation; assumptions stated; stability unclear; framework sensitivity minimal." Some triangulation through multiple evidence sources, but no systematic testing of alternative explanations or framework sensitivity. Appropriate for methodological advocacy, but readers should consider alternatives independently.

## Signal 6: Generalisability

**Score:** 76/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** Abductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good awareness of scope limitations and appropriately bounds its claims.

Explanatory scope is clearly bounded. The paper explicitly states that "many, but by no means all, archaeological projects could benefit from preregistration" (RD001). This appropriate hedging acknowledges that the recommendation has limits. The predictive/postdictive framework (M001) explicitly identifies when preregistration applies (predictive inquiry) and when it doesn't (postdictive/exploratory inquiry).

Contextual constraints are present. The paper acknowledges archaeological specificity — fieldwork constraints, just-in-time pressures, methodological diversity. The argument is explicitly about archaeology, not a universal claim about all disciplines.

Transfer conditions are partially specified. The paper discusses how preregistration might need adaptation for archaeological contexts (e.g., accommodating serendipitous finds, pilot research). However, specific transfer conditions (what makes a project suitable for preregistration) could be more precisely operationalised.

Limitations are acknowledged but somewhat diffuse. The paper mentions limitations throughout rather than consolidating them in a dedicated section. This distribution makes scope constraints less prominent than they could be.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- C003_consolidated: Explicitly addresses methodological diversity (inductive/deductive, idiographic/nomothetic)
- RD001: Appropriately hedged scope ("many, but by no means all")
- M001: Predictive/postdictive framework explicitly bounds applicability
- Paper addresses archaeological specificity (fieldwork constraints, just-in-time pressures)

**Weaknesses:**
- Transfer conditions not precisely operationalised (when exactly should a project preregister?)
- Limitations distributed throughout rather than consolidated
- Some claims about benefits may exceed evidence from other disciplines

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 76 (Good for abductive research). Meets 60-79 criteria: "Explanation scope stated; constraints present; transfer considerations mentioned; inference limitations acknowledged; applicability domain stated; some context discussion." Scope is appropriately hedged, constraints are present, and the paper acknowledges archaeological specificity. Falls short of Excellent because transfer conditions are not precisely specified and limitations are diffuse rather than consolidated.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Adequate-to-Strong

This methodological advocacy paper demonstrates strong plausibility (80) with the argument well-grounded in cross-disciplinary evidence and archaeological history. Validity (72) and Generalisability (76) are Good, indicating appropriate evidence support and scope awareness. Robustness (58) is Moderate, reflecting the argumentative nature of the paper rather than a severe weakness.

### Pattern Summary

The paper's strength lies in building a coherent, well-grounded case for preregistration based on extensive evidence from other disciplines and archaeological history. The argument is plausible and appropriately scoped. The relative weakness is in systematic testing of alternatives — the paper assumes preregistration is the best explanation rather than demonstrating it through comparison with other transparency mechanisms.

### Signal Coherence

The scores are internally consistent:
- High Plausibility (80) + Good Validity (72) = argument is well-grounded and supported
- Moderate Robustness (58) = alternatives not systematically tested (appropriate for advocacy)
- Good Generalisability (76) = scope appropriately bounded

The Robustness score being lowest is expected for this paper type — methodological advocacy papers argue for a position rather than testing multiple alternatives.

### Implications for Overall Credibility

**For final credibility assessment:**
- This is a strong methodological argument with appropriate evidence support
- Readers should consider alternative transparency approaches independently
- The recommendation (adopt preregistration) is plausible and well-grounded, even if not rigorously demonstrated to be "best"
- Scope limitations are acknowledged — not all projects benefit equally

**For Cluster 3:**
- No computational component → Methodological Transparency variant expected
- Focus on reasoning traceability (strong in this paper)
- Argument structure supports reproducibility of reasoning even without computational reproduction
