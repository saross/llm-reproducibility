Pass 2: Claims & Evidence Rationalization
Consolidates 113 claims to ~93 claims (17.7% reduction, 20 items)

REVISED STRATEGY (more conservative to hit 14-24 item target):
- Preserve ALL evidence items (15) - no consolidation
- Consolidate 20 claims (17.7% reduction) → 93 claims
- Preserve ALL implicit arguments (26) - no consolidation
- Final total: ~134 items (within 130-140 target)

Conservative adjustments from initial analysis:
- Group 4: Consolidate ONLY C016+C020 (not all 5 items)
- Group 7: Consolidate ONLY C030+C046 (not all pairs)
- Group 11: Consolidate ONLY C087+C088 (not all 5 items)
- Other groups: Keep as planned
