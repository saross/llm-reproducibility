  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is FAIMS Mobile software platform for field data collection across disciplines. Paper presents tool capabilities, technical architecture (Section 2.1), software functionalities (Section 2.2), and design decisions. Results/Impact section (Section 4) describes software adoption and user benefits, not substantive research findings about phenomena. Three archaeological case studies (Sobotkova et al. 2016) are referenced but serve demonstrative function for the software, not as the primary contribution. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a paper USING a method to study archaeological phenomena. Claims are about software capabilities (C009: 'generalised software combining features for field research', C015: 'designed for offline use', C025: 'append-only datastore provides version history') rather than claims about phenomena in the world.",

No formal hypothesis-testing of software performance. No systematic benchmark comparison with alternative tools (ODK, ARK, Heurist, Kora mentioned qualitatively but not systematically evaluated). Validation is descriptive demonstration through case studies and adoption evidence."

FAIMS validation is inductive/descriptive: software capabilities demonstrated through illustrative case studies and supported by adoption metrics. No deductive hypothesis-testing of tool performance against benchmarks. No abductive inference about design alternatives. Primary contribution is technical specification and descriptive demonstration of features and impact. Confidence is high because: (1) paper type classification is unambiguous (software publication in SoftwareX), (2) validation approach is clearly inductive (case studies, adoption metrics, qualitative user feedback), (3) no mixed elements requiring qualification."

Technology stack explicitly listed (Javarosa, SQLite3, Spatialite, Beanshell, etc.). Definition packet structure and customisation approaches (XML/Beanshell/CSS vs DSL) thoroughly explained. Deployment workflow (P001) and independent customisation paths (P006) documented. Open source licence (GPLv3) and multiple repository links provided. Very high transparency for a methodological software paper - exceeds typical software publication standards."

Primary signals: (1) Transparency of design decisions, technical architecture, and customisation approach - STRONG in this paper with detailed Section 2 documentation; (2) Reproducibility - excellent: GPLv3 open source, GitHub repositories, Google Play distribution, installation scripts, comprehensive documentation; (3) Comprehensibility of technical specification and feature descriptions - clear and well-organised. Secondary: Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the software's capabilities (e.g., claims about efficiency gains, adoption benefits). Deemphasised: Generalisability and Robustness of case studies - the three referenced archaeological case studies are illustrative demonstrations, not meant to prove software works in all contexts. Expected moderate robustness (40-60) is appropriate for software_tool subtype per context flag guidance."

  "classification_notes": "Straightforward software tool methodological paper. SoftwareX journal specialises in this genre. FAIMS Mobile is well-documented open-source software with clear validation through case studies and adoption metrics. No ambiguities or edge cases in classification. Paper represents exemplary methodological transparency for software publication genre. Context flag 📦 (Descriptive/Artefact Paper) applies - moderate Robustness is expected and not a deficiency."
