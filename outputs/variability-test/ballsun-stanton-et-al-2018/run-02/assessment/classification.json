The paper presents software architecture, features, deployment methodology, and adoption metrics. While case studies are referenced (Sobotkova et al. 2016), this paper itself does not present empirical research findings. The revealed inductive approach reflects the iterative development process where features emerged from fieldwork experience, but traditional research approach classification is not directly applicable to software publications."
