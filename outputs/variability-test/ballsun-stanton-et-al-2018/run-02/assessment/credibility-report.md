   - Full source code availability (GitHub, GPLv3)
   - Docker-based deployment for reproducibility
   - 24 public module definitions as templates
   - FAIR score: 92.5% (37/40)

2. **Strong Practical Impact Evidence**
   - 45 project modules created
   - 80+ researchers trained
   - 30,000+ records from 3 deployments
   - Cross-disciplinary adoption (archaeology, geoscience, history, ecology)

3. **Transparent Development Process**
   - 5-year iterative co-development documented
   - User-centred design approach
   - Clear problem-solution alignment

4. **Honest Limitation Acknowledgment**
   - Sustainability concerns explicitly noted
   - Technical requirements clearly stated
   - Server dependency documented

### Limitations

1. **Self-Reported Metrics**
   - Adoption statistics from development team
   - No independent validation or user studies
   - Potential selection bias in reported deployments

2. **Missing Comparative Analysis**
   - Limited benchmarking against alternatives
   - 90% efficiency claim lacks baseline documentation
   - No formal usability evaluation

3. **Theoretical Positioning**
   - Minimal engagement with software engineering literature
   - Implicit rather than explicit theoretical framework
   - Limited positioning in broader research infrastructure discourse

4. **Sustainability Uncertainty**
   - Grant-funded model explicitly flagged
   - Long-term maintenance unclear
   - Single institutional dependency
