# Track A Quality Gating Assessment

**Paper:** Ballsun-Stanton et al. (2018) - FAIMS Mobile: Flexible, open-source software for field research
**Run:** run-02
**Assessment Date:** 2025-12-02

## Paper Classification Summary

- **Paper Type:** Methodological (Software Publication)
- **Research Approach:** Revealed inductive (iterative co-development)
- **Context Flags:** 🔧 (methodological/tool development)

## Quality Gate Determination

### Gate Criteria Assessment

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Clear research objective | ✅ PASS | Software description with clear purpose: field data collection platform |
| Identifiable methods/approach | ✅ PASS | Co-development methodology, open-source development practices |
| Evidence supports claims | ✅ PASS | Deployment statistics, adoption metrics, feature descriptions |
| Internal consistency | ✅ PASS | Consistent narrative from problem to solution to impact |
| Appropriate for paper type | ✅ PASS | Meets SoftwareX publication standards |

### Quality Pathway Assignment

**Assigned Pathway:** HIGH

**Justification:** This software publication meets all quality gate criteria for its paper type. The paper:

1. **Clear Purpose:** Addresses the well-defined problem of data collection in field research contexts with poor connectivity
2. **Transparent Methods:** Documents the co-development approach with field researchers across disciplines
3. **Verifiable Claims:** Provides concrete adoption metrics (45 deployments, 80+ researchers, 30,000 records from 3 projects)
4. **Reproducible Infrastructure:** Open-source (GPLv3), public GitHub repository, Docker deployment, comprehensive documentation
5. **Appropriate Scope:** Follows SoftwareX format for software publications

## Methodological Paper Considerations

For methodological/software publications, the standard empirical research criteria are adapted:

### Adapted Assessment Framework

| Standard Criterion | Adaptation for Software Paper | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Hypothesis testing | → Feature justification | Strong: Features justified by fieldwork needs |
| Sample description | → Deployment scope | Strong: 45 modules, multiple disciplines |
| Data collection | → Development process | Strong: 5-year iterative development documented |
| Statistical analysis | → Performance/adoption metrics | Moderate: Counts provided, limited quantitative analysis |
| Generalisability | → Cross-domain applicability | Strong: Archaeology, geoscience, history, ecology |

### Software-Specific Quality Indicators

| Indicator | Present | Quality |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Source code availability | ✅ | GitHub repository with GPLv3 licence |
| Installation documentation | ✅ | Docker-based deployment |
| Usage documentation | ✅ | Wiki with 24 module definitions |
| Version control | ✅ | Git-based development |
| Community support | ✅ | Referenced training workshops |
| Sustainability model | ⚠️ | Grant-funded, sustainability concerns noted |

## Implications for Cluster Assessments

Given the HIGH pathway assignment, full assessment across all three clusters is warranted:

1. **Cluster 1 (Foundational Clarity):** Evaluate clarity of software purpose, problem definition, and solution approach
2. **Cluster 2 (Evidential Strength):** Assess evidence for adoption, impact, and effectiveness claims
3. **Cluster 3 (Reproducibility):** Evaluate software reproducibility, deployment replicability, and documentation quality

## Quality Gate Summary

| Component | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Clarity | 4/5 | Clear purpose and structure; some technical details assume expertise |
| Completeness | 4/5 | Comprehensive for software paper; limited comparative analysis |
| Consistency | 5/5 | Internally consistent throughout |
| Credibility | 4/5 | Strong evidence base; self-reported metrics |
| **Overall** | **HIGH** | Proceeds to full cluster assessment |
