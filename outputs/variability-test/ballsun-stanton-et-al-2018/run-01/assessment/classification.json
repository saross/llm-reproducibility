  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is FAIMS Mobile software platform for cross-disciplinary field data collection. Paper presents tool capabilities, technical architecture, design decisions, and deployment workflow. The 'Impact' section describes user experiences and software adoption statistics, not substantive research findings. Three archaeological case studies are referenced (Sobotkova et al. 2016) but serve demonstrative/illustrative function to show software capabilities, not as primary contribution. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a paper USING a method to study archaeological phenomena. Claims are about software properties (offline capability, customisability, sync features), not about archaeological patterns or processes.",

No formal hypothesis-testing of software performance, no systematic comparison with alternative tools using benchmark metrics, no controlled evaluation. Validation is purely descriptive/demonstrative - shows what the tool can do through deployment experience and user reports. Three deployment case studies published separately (Sobotkova et al. 2016) provide illustrative validation. Impact claims based on self-reported user feedback (~300 users, 20,000+ hours logged) without independent verification."

FAIMS Mobile validation is inductive/descriptive: software capabilities demonstrated through deployment case studies and aggregated user feedback. Evidence types include software specifications (E001-E004), deployment statistics (E020-E021), user feedback quotes (E029-E033), and comparative observations with alternatives like ODK (E007-E012). No deductive hypothesis-testing of tool performance against pre-specified criteria. No abductive inference about design solutions. Primary contribution is technical specification and descriptive demonstration of what the platform can do. Confidence is high because validation strategy is clear, consistent with software publication genre, and appropriate for the contribution type."

Open source licensing (GPLv3), repository locations (GitHub), and documentation links provided. High transparency for methodological software paper - readers can inspect code, replicate deployments, and verify claims about software functionality."

Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the software (do features work as described? is co-development approach plausible?). Generalisability and Robustness of case studies explicitly deemphasised - deployment demonstrations are illustrative examples of what the tool CAN do, not claims that all deployments WILL succeed or that findings generalise beyond demonstrated contexts."

  "classification_notes": "Software tool publication following SoftwareX journal format. Classification based on validation approach (inductive demonstration), not substantive research approach. Context flags: 📦 (infrastructure/artefact paper - describes software artefact rather than testing hypotheses), 🔧 (methodological transparency - assess whether users can install, use, and extend the software). Different signal priorities apply compared to empirical research papers. Robustness expectations are moderate (40-60) per genre conventions - software papers describe artefacts, not test hypotheses. Key strength is transparency (open source, documented). Key limitation is validation relying on self-reported user feedback without independent verification."
