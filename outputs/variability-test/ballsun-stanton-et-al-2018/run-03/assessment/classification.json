  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is FAIMS Mobile software platform for field research data collection across disciplines. Paper presents tool capabilities, technical architecture, design decisions, and deployment experience. Results section describes software features, adoption metrics, and user feedback, not substantive research findings about archaeological or other phenomena. Three archaeological case studies included (referenced from Sobotkova et al., 2016) serve demonstrative/illustrative function, not as primary contribution. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a paper USING a method to study phenomena.",

    "validation_notes": "FAIMS capabilities demonstrated through descriptive case study references and adoption metrics (40 customisations, 29 deployments, 300 users, 20,000 hours). User feedback collected from published case studies shows qualitative benefits (data quality, efficiency, workflow improvements). No formal hypothesis-testing of software performance, no systematic comparison with alternative tools, no benchmark testing. Validation is inductive/descriptive - demonstrates what the tool can do through deployment experience and user testimonials."

Claims describe software features and user experiences, not phenomena in the world.",

M001-M004 describe software configuration methods and QA approaches. These are not methods applied to research questions.",

FAIMS validation is inductive/descriptive: software capabilities demonstrated through deployment experience (40 customisations, 29 deployments), adoption metrics (300 users, 20,000 hours), and qualitative user feedback from case studies. No deductive hypothesis-testing of tool performance or abductive inference about design choices. Primary contribution is technical specification with descriptive demonstration through deployment history. Confidence is high because validation strategy is clear and appropriate for software tool paper in SoftwareX."

Primary signals: (1) Transparency of design decisions and technical architecture - documented via Code metadata and Software architecture sections, (2) Reproducibility of software - open source GPLv3, GitHub repository, installation requirements documented, (3) Comprehensibility of technical specification - clear documentation structure. Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the software (capabilities work as described). Generalisability and Robustness of case studies deemphasised - demonstrations are illustrative, showing tool capabilities across archaeology, ecology, geoscience, and history, not meant to make generalisable claims about those domains."
    }
  },

  "classification_notes": "Software tool paper published in SoftwareX. Classification based on validation approach (inductive demonstration through deployment experience), not substantive research approach. Paper type is clearly methodological with excellent taxonomy fit - this is a canonical example of software tool publication. Different signal priorities apply compared to empirical research papers: emphasis on technical transparency, software reproducibility (open source, documented dependencies), and specification comprehensibility rather than robustness of findings."
