  "paper_type_justification": "This is an original software publication describing FAIMS Mobile, a field data collection platform. The paper documents software architecture, features, and deployment impact rather than presenting new empirical research findings. The SoftwareX journal format explicitly categorises this as 'Original software publication'.",

  "research_approach_confidence": "medium",
  "research_approach_justification": "The paper presents software developed through iterative co-development with field researchers over five years. Impact claims are derived inductively from deployment experiences and user feedback. No hypotheses were pre-specified; instead, software capabilities emerged from accumulated field experience. The validation approach relies on case studies and usage metrics rather than deductive testing.",
