## Quality Criteria Evaluation

### 1. Extraction Completeness

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Evidence count | ✅ 43 items | Comprehensive technical specifications and outcomes |
| Claims count | ✅ 58 items | Full coverage of paper's argumentation |
| Implicit arguments | ✅ 8 items | Key assumptions identified |
| Research designs | ✅ 4 items | Appropriate for software publication |
| Methods | ✅ 4 items | Documentation and analysis methods captured |
| Protocols | ✅ 9 items | Documentation procedures extracted |
| Infrastructure | ✅ Complete | Funding, repositories, FAIR assessment populated |

**Verdict:** Extraction is comprehensive relative to paper content.

### 2. Metric-Signal Alignment

| Metric Category | Signals Supported | Alignment |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Code availability | Transparency, Reproducibility | ✅ Strong |
| Documentation completeness | Transparency, Comprehensibility | ✅ Strong |
| Deployment statistics | Validity (limited), Generalisability | ⚠️ Moderate |
| User feedback | Validity, Robustness | ⚠️ Moderate (self-report) |
| FAIR assessment | Reproducibility | ✅ Strong |

**Verdict:** Good alignment for software-focused signals; impact evidence is softer.

### 3. Classification Confidence

| Dimension | Confidence | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Paper type | High | Explicit "Original software publication" designation |
| Research approach | Medium | Inductive implicit in genre, not stated |
| Context flags | High | Clear software/methodological focus |

**Verdict:** Classification sufficiently confident for assessment.

### 4. Source Verification Status

- **Verbatim quotes:** All evidence and claims have source quotes
- **Locations:** All items have section/page locations
- **Cross-references:** Bidirectional consistency maintained
- **Known uncertainties:** 4 documented (deployment tracking, external case studies, user feedback methodology, feature usage evidence)

**Verdict:** Source verification adequate; uncertainties documented.

## Quality Gating Decision

### Route: FULL ASSESSMENT (Track A → Clusters 1-3)

**Rationale:**
1. Extraction quality meets thresholds
2. Classification is confident
3. Paper type (software publication) allows meaningful assessment
4. Infrastructure data (code, FAIR) provides strong foundation for Transparency and Reproducibility signals
5. Impact evidence exists (though caveated) for Validity and Generalisability signals

### Caveats for Assessment

1. **Impact evidence quality:** User-reported outcomes lack independent verification. Weight Validity signal accordingly.
2. **Generalisability scope:** Cross-disciplinary claims (ecology, geoscience, history) rest on archaeology case studies. Note evidence gaps.
3. **Software publication genre:** Standard empirical criteria (e.g., Robustness through replication) may not apply. Adapt assessment framework.
