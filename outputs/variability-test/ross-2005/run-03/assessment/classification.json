  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper collects and analyses textual evidence from Homeric poems to investigate a historical phenomenon: proto-Panhellenic identity formation in eighth-century BCE Greece. While the subject matter is literary texts, the research question targets a historical phenomenon (Greek collective identity) not the texts themselves as artefacts. Claims describe, explain, and interpret patterns in linguistic representation that reflect real historical conditions. The paper uses philological methods as tools for historical investigation rather than studying philological methods themselves. Primary contribution is understanding identity formation, not presenting new analytical methodology.",

However, 'empirical' category is optimised for scientific fieldwork with measurements and datasets. Interpretive humanities scholarship using textual evidence as data fits acceptably but requires contextual adaptation of signal expectations."

Absence of explicit methodology section is disciplinary convention for philological scholarship in this field and era. Interpretive approach is embedded in practice rather than stated explicitly. This is typical genre convention for literary/philological analysis, not methodological weakness."

Core claims like C026 ('nascent Panhellenic identity based on linguistic unity') and C001 ('pan-Akhaian linguistic uniformity') are explanatory inferences from textual patterns. Claims do not test pre-specified hypotheses (deductive) nor merely describe patterns without interpretation (inductive). Instead, claims propose the best explanation for observed textual phenomena.",
      "methods_application": "Close reading methods (M001, M002, M003) are applied to identify patterns that are then explained through interpretive inference. The paper moves from observation (Akhaians never have language barriers; epikouroi always do) to inference about what this pattern best explains (proto-Panhellenic identity). Comparative analysis across epic tradition supports interpretive coherence.",
      "analytical_workflow": "Pattern observation → alternative explanations considered → inference to best explanation. The paper observes the asymmetric treatment of language (Trojans diverse, Akhaians uniform), considers what this pattern might mean, and argues for proto-Panhellenism as the best explanation consistent with oral tradition theory and historical context. This is classic abductive reasoning: inference to the best explanation of textual phenomena."

Classification based entirely on revealed approach inferred from claims structure and analytical workflow. Absence of explicit methodology is disciplinary convention for philological scholarship in Classical Philology, not methodological weakness or HARKing. The abductive approach (inference to best explanation) is standard practice in Homeric studies and literary interpretation."

  "primary_classification": {
    "approach": "abductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly abductive research: inference to the best explanation for observed textual patterns. The paper does not test pre-specified hypotheses (ruling out deductive). It goes beyond mere pattern description to offer interpretive explanation (ruling out purely inductive). Core claims like 'nascent Panhellenic identity' and 'proto-Panhellenism at early stage' are explanatory inferences that account for the observed pattern of linguistic representation in Homer. The methodology explicitly draws on oral tradition theory to argue that textual patterns reflect contemporary (eighth-century) identity formation rather than Bronze Age realities. This interpretive move—inferring historical conditions from literary representation—is paradigmatically abductive. Confidence is high because the interpretive/explanatory character of claims is unambiguous."

However, interpretive approach is clearly demonstrated through practice: close reading of specific passages, comparative analysis across texts, engagement with oral tradition scholarship. The oral tradition dating framework (RD002) is explicitly stated and justified. Transparency is moderate rather than low because reasoning is traceable even without explicit methodological framing. Disciplinary convention in Classics does not require explicit methodology sections for literary/philological analysis."

  "classification_notes": "Interpretive philology paper classified as empirical/abductive. Paper investigates historical phenomenon (proto-Panhellenism) through textual evidence from Homeric poems. The 'empirical' classification captures that this is evidence-based investigation of phenomena rather than methodological or theoretical paper, even though the evidence is textual rather than archaeological/scientific. The 'abductive' approach captures the interpretive inference to best explanation that characterises the analytical mode. Signal priorities adapted for humanities scholarship: plausibility of interpretation and validity of evidence-inference connections are primary; computational reproducibility is not applicable to traditional philological methodology."
