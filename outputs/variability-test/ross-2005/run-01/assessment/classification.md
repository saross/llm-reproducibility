## Paper Type Classification

### Primary Type: Empirical

**Rationale:** This paper analyses empirical evidence from primary sources (ancient Greek texts) to support claims about historical phenomena (proto-Panhellenism in eighth-century BCE Greece). While interpretive rather than quantitative, the paper makes claims about historical reality based on textual evidence.

**Subtype:** Interpretive Philology

The paper uses close reading and comparative analysis of ancient texts to reconstruct historical attitudes and identities. It examines linguistic patterns across Homer's Iliad, Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony, and Homeric Hymns.

---

## Research Approach Classification

### Primary Approach: Abductive (Inference to Best Explanation)

**Confidence:** High

**Evidence for Classification:**

1. **Explanatory Structure:** The paper proposes that the observed pattern of linguistic representation (diversity among Trojan allies, uniformity among Akhaians) is best explained by a nascent proto-Panhellenism in eighth-century BCE Greece.

2. **Key Quote (C001):**
   > "Even though no language barrier separates Akhaians from Trojans in the epics, the selective recognition of linguistic diversity among Trojan epikouroi, versus the homogeneity of the Akhaians, offers a glimpse of an undeveloped and unstable proto-Panhellenism."

3. **Alternative Explanations Considered:** The author considers and addresses alternative scholarly interpretations:
   - Opposition-based Panhellenism (rejected as anachronistic for eighth century)
   - Aggregative Panhellenism (accepted, with linguistic component added)
   - Literary convention vs historical reality (addressed via Mackie)

4. **Theoretical Framework:** Adopts Nagy's oral tradition theory to justify dating conclusions to the period of epic stabilisation (~700 BCE).

**Abductive Reasoning Pattern:**
- **Observation:** Three Iliad passages show linguistic diversity among Trojan allies but none among Akhaians
- **Puzzle:** Why this asymmetric treatment?
- **Best Explanation:** Reflects emerging proto-Panhellenic identity based on linguistic unity
- **Supporting Inference:** Pattern resonated with eighth-century audiences due to nascent Panhellenism

### Secondary Approach: Not Applicable

The paper does not employ a secondary research approach. It is purely abductive/interpretive.

---

## Expressed vs Revealed Approach

### Expressed Methodology

The author explicitly frames the work as philological analysis with historical implications:

> "The nature and importance of these passages can be better assessed by interpreting them in the context of the surviving body of early Greek epic poetry"

> "I chose to examine the Homeric Hymns for generic rather than chronological reasons, to place the Iliad in the context of the wider expectations and assumptions of epic poetry"

### Revealed Methodology

The revealed approach matches the expressed approach. The paper:
- Identifies textual patterns through close reading
- Proposes explanatory interpretations
- Tests interpretations against comparative evidence
- Situates findings within scholarly debate

**Alignment:** Matched

---

## Mixed Methods Assessment

**Is Mixed Methods:** No

This is a single-approach study using abductive reasoning throughout. While multiple texts are examined, the analytical method is consistent: philological interpretation seeking best explanation for observed patterns.

---

## Transparency Assessment

### Expressed Methodology Present: Partially

The paper describes its comparative approach and theoretical framework (oral tradition theory) but lacks explicit methodological statements typical of social science research. This is consistent with humanities conventions.

### Transparency Quality: Moderate

**Strengths:**
- Theoretical framework (Nagy) explicitly stated
- Comparative scope clearly defined
- Evidence (textual passages) fully cited with translations
- Scholarly positions engaged fairly

**Gaps:**
- No explicit statement of analytical procedures
- Passage selection criteria not systematically stated
- Completeness of textual survey not verifiable

---

## Taxonomy Fit Assessment

### Category Fit Quality: Good

The paper fits the abductive/interpretive category well. It:
- Proposes explanatory claims for observed patterns
- Evaluates alternative explanations
- Builds cumulative argument from multiple textual sources
- Acknowledges limitations and scope constraints

**Minor Tensions:** The paper could also be classified as "theoretical" since it contributes to theoretical understanding of Panhellenism. However, its primary contribution is interpreting empirical evidence (texts), not proposing new theory.

## Context Flags

**🔧 Methodological Transparency Variant**

Applicable for Reproducibility assessment. This interpretive paper has no computational workflow to reproduce; assessment should focus on whether readers can access sources and follow reasoning.

## Classification Rationale Summary

This classical philology paper uses abductive reasoning to explain patterns in Homer's representation of linguistic diversity. The author observes a consistent asymmetry (diversity among Trojan allies, uniformity among Akhaians) and proposes proto-Panhellenism as the best explanation, grounded in Nagy's oral tradition dating framework. The approach is empirical-interpretive rather than hypothetico-deductive: the author does not test pre-specified hypotheses but rather builds an explanatory case from accumulated textual evidence.

The high classification confidence reflects the paper's clear argumentative structure and explicit engagement with alternative scholarly positions.
