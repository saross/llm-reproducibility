  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper investigates a historical/cultural phenomenon (the emergence of proto-Panhellenism in eighth-century BCE Greece) through philological analysis of primary textual evidence from the Homeric epics. Although the subject matter is ancient literary texts, the research question targets a historical phenomenon (Greek collective identity formation) rather than the texts themselves as methodological artefacts. Claims describe, explain, and interpret patterns in linguistic representation that reflect real historical conditions. The paper uses philological methods as investigative tools to understand historical phenomena, not to develop or evaluate philological methodology itself. The primary contribution is understanding identity formation in early Greece, not presenting new analytical techniques.",

Absence of explicit methodology section reflects disciplinary conventions in classical philology, where interpretive approaches are typically embedded in argument rather than explicitly declared. This is standard genre convention for humanities scholarship in this field and era, not methodological weakness."

Core claims explain observed textual patterns through inference to best explanation of historical conditions. Pattern (linguistic asymmetry) is observed, then explained through historical/cultural interpretation.",
      "methods_application": "Methods M001-M003 (close reading, oral tradition theory, historiographical synthesis) are used interpretively to generate explanatory hypotheses about what textual patterns reveal about eighth-century Greek identity. Methods do not test pre-specified hypotheses or purely describe patterns - they support inference to best explanation.",
      "analytical_workflow": "Observation of textual pattern (linguistic diversity limited to Trojan allies) → consideration of alternative explanations → inference to best explanation (emerging non-oppositional Panhellenism). This follows abductive logic: surprising pattern → generate explanatory hypothesis → assess fit with evidence and theoretical context."

Classification based entirely on revealed approach inferred from claims structure and analytical workflow. The absence of declared methodology is standard disciplinary convention for classical philology in 2005. The paper's interpretive approach is implicit in its argument structure rather than explicitly stated, which is appropriate for this field and era."

  "primary_classification": {
    "approach": "abductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly abductive/interpretive research. The paper observes a textual pattern (differential treatment of linguistic diversity between Akhaians and Trojan allies), generates an explanatory hypothesis (nascent Panhellenism based on linguistic unity), and argues this is the best explanation for the observed data. Core claims (C022, C023) are interpretive conclusions that explain why Homer presents language this way. The paper is not deductive (no a priori hypotheses tested) nor purely inductive (not mere pattern description - claims go beyond observation to explanation). The abductive structure is clear: textual observation → interpretive hypothesis → inference to best explanation. Confidence is high because the abductive logic is unambiguous throughout."
