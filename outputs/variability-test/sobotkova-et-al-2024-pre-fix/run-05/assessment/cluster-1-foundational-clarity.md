## Signal 1: Comprehensibility

**Score:** 79/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Good comprehensibility with explicit, quantified claims. Logical progression from design through validation to interpretation. Technical terminology well-explained. Research question clearly testable though stated implicitly.

### Strengths
- Explicit quantified performance claims
- Clear experimental logic
- Technical terms defined

### Weaknesses
- Hypothesis implicit rather than formally stated

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 79 (Good) reflects clear argumentation and traceable logic. Approaches Excellent but implicit hypothesis prevents full score.

## Signal 2: Transparency

**Score:** 83/100 (Excellent)

### Assessment

Excellent transparency through complete code sharing in three GitHub repositories. Comprehensive methods documentation. Rare time-on-task reporting (135 hours). Extensive limitation acknowledgement including honest failure reporting.

### Strengths
- Three complete public repositories
- 135 person-hours documented
- Thorough limitation discussion
- Honest negative results

### Weaknesses
- Commercial imagery not shareable
- No pre-registration
- No formal environment specification

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 83 (Excellent) reflects exceptional code transparency, rare resource documentation, and scientific honesty. Meets Excellent despite data constraints.
