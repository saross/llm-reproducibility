|--------|-------|------|------------------|
| Comprehensibility | 76 | Good | Deductive |
| Transparency | 80 | Excellent | Deductive |

**Cluster Rating:** Strong

## Signal 1: Comprehensibility

**Score:** 76/100 (Good)

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good comprehensibility for deductive research. Core claims are explicit and quantified. The logical structure from design through validation is clear. Key domain terms (CNN, transfer learning, false positive/negative rates) are defined. The hypothesis (transfer learning can detect burial mounds) is implicit but testable.

### Strengths
- Claims explicit and quantified with specific percentages
- Clear logical structure from hypothesis through validation
- Key terms well-defined

### Weaknesses
- Hypothesis implicit rather than formally stated

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 76 (Good) reflects clear claims, defined terms, traceable structure. Falls short of Excellent because hypothesis is implicit.

## Signal 2: Transparency

**Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

### Assessment

Excellent transparency with three public GitHub repositories covering complete analytical pipeline. Methods comprehensively documented. Limitations extensively discussed. Data availability limited by commercial imagery constraints.

### Strengths
- Three public code repositories
- Comprehensive methods documentation
- Extensive limitation acknowledgement

### Weaknesses
- No pre-registration
- Commercial imagery not shareable

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 80 (Excellent) reflects exceptional code sharing and thorough methods documentation. Meets Excellent threshold despite data access limitations.
