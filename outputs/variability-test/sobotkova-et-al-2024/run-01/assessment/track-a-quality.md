## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Extraction Quality

**Rating:** HIGH

- Evidence items: 17 (well-documented quantitative measurements)
- Claims: 16 (clear empirical and interpretive claims)
- Implicit arguments: 5 (well-reasoned inferences)
- RDMAP: 3 designs, 4 methods, 5 protocols (complete hierarchy)

**Rationale:** Comprehensive extraction with strong verbatim quote support. All major sections covered with explicit source verification.

### 2. Classification Confidence

**Rating:** HIGH

- Paper type: Empirical (clear)
- Research approach: Deductive (revealed) with high confidence
- No HARKing indicators detected
- Context flags appropriately assigned (negative_results: true)

**Rationale:** Clear hypothesis-testing structure with external validation design.

### 3. Metric-Signal Alignment

**Rating:** HIGH

- Quantitative metrics present for all core claims
- F1 scores, detection rates, false positive/negative rates explicitly reported
- Time-on-task (135 hours) documented
- Code availability verified (3 repositories)

**Rationale:** Exceptional metric documentation enables precise signal assessment.

## Quality Gating Decision

**Quality State:** HIGH

**Assessment Pathway:** Standard (full assessment with precise scores)

**Rationale:** All quality dimensions rate HIGH. Proceed with full seven-signal assessment using approach-specific anchors for deductive research.
