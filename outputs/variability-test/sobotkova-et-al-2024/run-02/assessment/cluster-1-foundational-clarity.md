## Signal 1: Comprehensibility

**Score:** 78/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Good comprehensibility with quantified claims and clear logical flow. Purpose explicitly stated as "cautionary tale." Technical concepts explained. Research question testable through comparative design.

### Strengths

- Explicit quantified performance metrics
- Clear experimental structure
- Technical terms defined

### Weaknesses

- Implicit hypothesis formulation
- Some ML detail assumes background

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 78 (Good) reflects clear argumentation with traceable logic. Approaches but does not reach Excellent due to implicit hypothesis.

## Signal 2: Transparency

**Score:** 83/100 (Excellent)

### Assessment

Excellent transparency via three public GitHub repositories. Comprehensive method documentation. Rare 135 person-hour time reporting. Extensive limitation acknowledgement.

### Strengths

- Three complete code repositories
- 135 hours documented
- Honest failure reporting
- Thorough limitations

### Weaknesses

- Commercial imagery restricted
- No environment specification
- No pre-registration

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 83 (Excellent) for exceptional code transparency and resource documentation.
