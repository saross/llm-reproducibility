## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 74/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Well-grounded in transfer learning literature. Research question motivated by gap between optimistic literature and challenges. Counterintuitive findings explained through mechanism.

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 74 (Good) for strong theoretical grounding with implicit hypothesis.

---

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

### Assessment

Rigorous validation against 773 independent field-verified mounds. Two-run comparison tests alternative hypothesis. Appropriate methods. Extensive limitation acknowledgement.

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 80 (Excellent) for rigorous independent validation.

---

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 68/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Two-run comparison provides meaningful robustness test. Consistent failure strengthens conclusions. Limited parameter exploration.

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 68 (Good) for meaningful comparison but limited sensitivity testing.

---

## Signal 6: Generalisability

**Score:** 75/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Claims bounded to Kazanlak Valley. Landscape heterogeneity identified as key factor. Transfer conditions specified. Authors avoid overgeneralisation.

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 75 (Good) for appropriate scope constraint. Single site limits scope.
