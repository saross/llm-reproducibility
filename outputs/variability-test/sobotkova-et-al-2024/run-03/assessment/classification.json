  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper conducts primary empirical research testing CNN-based machine learning for archaeological feature detection. The research question targets phenomena in the world (burial mound visibility in satellite imagery, ML model performance on archaeological features). Claims describe, explain, and predict phenomena (e.g., false positive/negative rates, model behaviour patterns). The CNN methodology is a tool used to investigate the research question, not the subject being investigated - the paper tests whether transfer learning approaches work for archaeological prospection, not whether CNNs are a valid technology in general. The comparison of model performance against field-validated ground truth is hypothesis-testing empirical research.",

    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly deductive hypothesis-testing research. The paper tests the proposition that pre-trained CNNs with minimal additional training ('low-touch approach') can effectively detect archaeological features. The research design is explicitly comparative (two runs with different training data), with pre-specified predictions tested against ground-truth field data. The expressed and revealed approaches align: the paper claims to test a hypothesis and actually does so through systematic experimental comparison. The conclusion ('low-touch approach did not work', 95-96% false negatives) directly addresses the a priori research question. Classification confidence is high because the deductive structure is unambiguous throughout the paper."

Generalisability appropriately constrained to Bulgarian burial mounds and specific imagery type."

The 'cautionary tale' framing is explicitly positioned as testing the proposition that low-touch transfer learning works for archaeological prospection. The comparative two-run design with field validation constitutes rigorous hypothesis testing. Notable transparency in reporting negative results and resource requirements. Classification straightforward; no edge cases or ambiguities."
