# Cluster 2: Evidential Strength Assessment

**Paper:** sobotkova-et-al-2024 | **Run:** 04 | **Date:** 2025-12-01

## Signal Scores

| Signal | Score | Band |
|--------|-------|------|
| Plausibility | 75 | Good |
| Validity | 80 | Excellent |
| Robustness | 68 | Good |
| Generalisability | 76 | Good |

**Cluster Rating:** Strong

## Signal 3: Plausibility (75 - Good)

Grounded in transfer learning literature. Counterintuitive results explained.

## Signal 4: Validity (80 - Excellent)

773 independent field-verified mounds. Two-run comparison. Appropriate methods.

## Signal 5: Robustness (68 - Good)

Two-run comparison valuable. Limited parameter exploration.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (76 - Good)

Claims bounded appropriately. Single site limits scope.
