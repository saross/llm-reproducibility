## Signal 1: Comprehensibility

**Score:** 78/100 (Good)

### Assessment

Good comprehensibility with clearly stated, quantified claims. Logical structure progresses from experimental design through validation to interpretation. Technical terms appropriately defined. Research question is testable though not formally stated as hypothesis.

### Strengths
- Explicit quantified claims with performance metrics
- Clear experimental logic
- Technical terminology adequately explained

### Weaknesses
- Hypothesis implicit rather than formally stated

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 78 (Good) reflects clear argumentation, quantified outcomes, and traceable logic. Falls short of Excellent due to implicit hypothesis.

## Signal 2: Transparency

**Score:** 82/100 (Excellent)

### Assessment

Excellent transparency through three complete public GitHub repositories. Methods comprehensively documented with explicit protocols. Rare reporting of development time (135 hours). Extensive limitation discussion. Data access constrained only by commercial imagery licensing.

### Strengths
- Complete code in three public repositories
- Rare time-on-task documentation
- Thorough limitation acknowledgement
- Honest negative results reporting

### Weaknesses
- Commercial satellite imagery not shareable
- No formal pre-registration

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 82 (Excellent) reflects exceptional code sharing, honest failure reporting, and rare resource documentation. Meets Excellent despite data access constraints.
