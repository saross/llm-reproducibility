## Signal Scores

| Signal | Score | Band |
|--------|-------|------|
| Plausibility | 76 | Good |
| Validity | 81 | Excellent |
| Robustness | 69 | Good |
| Generalisability | 77 | Good |

**Cluster Rating:** Strong

## Signal 3: Plausibility (76 - Good)

Well-grounded in transfer learning literature. Research question motivated by prior successes and critical gap. Counterintuitive results explained through background feature detection mechanism.

## Signal 4: Validity (81 - Excellent)

Rigorous external validation against 773 independently verified mounds. Two-run comparison tests alternative hypothesis. Methods appropriate for research question.

## Signal 5: Robustness (69 - Good)

Two-run design provides meaningful robustness test. Consistent failure across both approaches strengthens conclusions. Limited parameter sensitivity exploration.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (77 - Good)

Claims appropriately bounded to Kazanlak Valley. Comparison to Siberian success explicitly addresses landscape heterogeneity. Transfer conditions specified.
