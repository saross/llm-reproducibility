  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper collects and analyses empirical data about phenomena (burial mound detection using CNN). The research question targets archaeological feature detection in the real world, not the development of a new method. Claims describe and explain empirical findings (detection rates, false positive/negative rates). While machine learning methods are central, they are tools used to investigate archaeological prospection—not the subject being investigated. The primary contribution is understanding whether CNN-based detection works for burial mounds, supported by field validation against ground-truth survey data.",

      "claims_structure": "Claims are empirical findings testing model performance: C01 'Validation of results against field data showed that self-reported success rates were misleadingly high', C10 'Although the first model reported a good fit (F1 = 0.87), validation with field data showed the model was confusing our target features'. These are hypothesis-test style claims comparing predicted vs actual performance.",
      "methods_application": "M02 (CNN transfer learning) and M03 (spatial validation against ground-truth) form a deductive testing workflow.

This is a classic hypothesis-testing workflow: the implicit hypothesis is that the CNN will reliably detect burial mounds, and validation data tests this prediction."

The approach is consistent: train model, generate predictions, validate against independent ground-truth. No post-hoc hypothesis formation; the validation framework was established before results were known. Methodological transparency is high."

    "approach": "deductive",

This prediction is tested against pre-existing field survey data (773 mounds from TRAP 2009-2011). The analytical workflow follows hypothesis-testing logic: model training → prediction generation → validation against independent data → performance assessment. Results (95-96% false negative rates, 87-95% false positive rates) definitively reject the hypothesis. The revealed approach matches the expressed approach. Both model runs (2021 with all mounds, 2022 with visible mounds only) follow the same deductive validation framework."

Transparency already high. Generalisability appropriately constrained to Kazanlak Valley context."

  "classification_notes": "Strong deductive validation study with clear hypothesis-testing framework. The paper's strength is its systematic validation against independent field data, which exposes the gap between model self-reported performance (F1=0.87) and real-world utility (95-96% false negative rates). Literature review component is secondary but adds valuable context about publication bias in archaeological ML research. No classification ambiguities."
