## Key Strengths

1. **Large sample size** - 135 individuals with extensive chronological coverage
2. **Multi-method analysis** - PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH
3. **Public data** - ENA repository (PRJEB62503)
4. **Quality control** - Rigorous contamination assessment

## Key Limitations

1. **No code sharing** - Analysis scripts unavailable
2. **Geographic specificity** - Results limited to study region
3. **Implicit procedures** - Some analytical choices undocumented
