## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 77/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The observed patterns demonstrate strong consistency with established archaeogenomic frameworks for the Carpathian Basin and Lower Danube. Key findings about genetic continuity between Neolithic and Copper Age populations align with existing models of Anatolian farmer ancestry persistence in southeastern Europe. The central discovery — that genetic contact between farming and pastoralist groups occurred approximately 1000 years earlier than archaeological evidence suggested — represents a refinement rather than contradiction of existing frameworks.

Classifications employ standard archaeogenomic terminology (Neolithic, Copper Age, Eneolithic, Early Bronze Age chronological designations) and established ancestry components (Anatolian_N, WHG, EHG, CHG, steppe-related ancestry). The paper acknowledges complexities: variable steppe ancestry proportions across CA individuals, site-specific patterns at Yagodna and Pietrele, and the distinction between EHG-rich and full steppe ancestry.

Interpretations are grounded in robust comparative datasets from published reference populations (Turkey_N, Iron Gates HG, Yamnaya Samara, Steppe Eneolithic). The multi-proxy analytical approach (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm) provides theoretical grounding through convergent pattern identification.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- C03: "Genetic continuity existed between Neolithic and Copper Age groups" — consistent with established Anatolian farmer persistence models
- C01: "Early contact between farming and pastoralist groups occurred approximately 1000 years earlier than indicated by archaeological evidence" — discovery that refines temporal understanding
- RD01: Multi-site design enables pattern triangulation across the contact zone

**Weaknesses:**
- Implicit arguments (IA01-IA10) suggest unstated assumptions about population continuity and replacement dynamics
- "Earlier than anticipated" framing depends on prior archaeological models that may have been underdetermined

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 77 (Good for inductive). Patterns consistent with established archaeogenomic frameworks (60-79). Classifications use standard conventions (60-79). Major anomalies (variable steppe proportions) addressed through contextualisation (60-79). Interpretations have strong comparative basis with established reference populations. Minor deduction for implicit theoretical assumptions.

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 81/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The evidence base is sufficient and representative for the pattern claims made. The dataset comprises 135 successfully analysed ancient individuals from 8 distinct archaeological sites spanning approximately 3000 years (Neolithic through Early Bronze Age). This represents substantial coverage for regional archaeogenomic pattern claims.

The temporal transect sampling strategy (RD02) systematically targets key transition periods: Neolithic baseline, Copper Age transformation, Eneolithic developments, and Early Bronze Age outcomes. Sampling captures both the contact zone (southeastern Europe) and steppe margin (northwestern Black Sea region).

Methods are appropriate for archaeogenomic population history reconstruction. The multi-proxy approach combines complementary techniques: PCA for visualising population structure, f-statistics for testing affinity relationships, qpAdm for ancestry proportion modelling, IBD for detecting recent relatedness, and ROH for assessing population isolation. This methodological triangulation provides convergent evidence.

Claims are appropriately scoped to the sampled region and time period. The paper does not extrapolate findings to broader European patterns without qualification.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- E01: 135 individuals successfully analysed from 216 attempted — substantial ancient DNA sample size
- RD02: "Temporal transect sampling strategy targeting key transition periods" — systematic chronological coverage
- RD04: "Comparative site analysis" with IBD assessment addresses within-region population structure

**Weaknesses:**
- Temporal representation uneven: CA dominates (n≈95) while Neolithic limited (n=1)
- Site selection may privilege contexts with better DNA preservation (petrous bones)

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 81 (Excellent for inductive). Data sufficient for regional pattern claims (80-100). Sampling systematic through temporal transect design (80-100). Coverage spans 8 sites and 4 chronological periods (80-100). Multi-proxy methods provide convergent evidence (80-100). Limitations acknowledged regarding preservation bias and temporal gaps (80-100). Claims scoped appropriately to southeastern Europe/Black Sea region.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 74/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Pattern identification demonstrates good methodological triangulation across multiple independent analytical approaches. PCA projection identifies visual clustering, f-statistics test formal genetic affinities, qpAdm models ancestry proportions, and IBD/ROH analyses detect relatedness and demographic patterns. Convergent findings across these methods strengthen pattern claims.

The use of both proximal and distal qpAdm modelling tests sensitivity to reference population choices. Testing whether SEE_CA or Maykop serves as a better farmer-related source demonstrates model exploration. Alternative ancestry models are considered (four-way vs two-way models).

Classification schemes follow established archaeogenomic conventions ensuring comparability with published studies. Standard reference populations (Turkey_N, WHG, EHG, CHG) and chronological designations enable cross-study comparisons.

Sampling sensitivity is partially documented through the 135/216 success rate, acknowledging preservation constraints. However, systematic sensitivity analysis of how ancestry proportion estimates vary with reference population composition is limited.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- M03-M06: Multi-proxy approach combining PCA, f-statistics, proximal qpAdm, distal qpAdm
- M08-M10: IBD and ROH analyses provide independent relatedness evidence
- RD02: Systematic sampling across temporal transect

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited explicit sensitivity analysis of qpAdm proportion estimates
- Reference population composition effects not fully explored
- No formal inter-coder reliability for archaeological period assignments

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 74 (Good for inductive). Methodological triangulation present across multiple methods (60-79). Main ancestry patterns robust across PCA, f-statistics, and qpAdm (60-79). Standard classification schemes ensure consistency (60-79). Some sampling sensitivity acknowledged (60-79). Would require explicit sensitivity analysis for 80-100 band.

## Signal 7: Generalisability

**Score:** 73/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Pattern claims are explicitly bounded by geography and chronology. The paper consistently frames findings as pertaining to "southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region" during the period approximately 5400-2400 BC. This represents appropriate scope constraint for an inductive study.

Sampling limitations are acknowledged through site and individual counts. The 8 sites (Yagodna, Pietrele, Smyadovo, Hotnitsa, Varna, Boyadzik, Mayak, Usatove) provide geographic coverage but cannot capture full regional variation. Temporal coverage is uneven, with Copper Age substantially better represented than Neolithic or EBA.

Transfer conditions are partially specified. The findings about early contact are explicitly framed as relevant to the "contact zone" between farming and incoming pastoralist societies. However, explicit discussion of how findings might transfer to other European contact zones (e.g., central Europe, western Balkans) is limited.

The paper contextualises findings within broader European archaeogenomics literature but does not overclaim universal significance.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- RD01: Explicit geographic bounding to southeastern Europe and northwestern Black Sea region
- C01: Temporal scope explicitly stated (approximately 5400-2400 BC)
- E01-E64: Sample coverage (8 sites, 135 individuals) explicitly documented

**Weaknesses:**
- Transfer to other European contact zones not explicitly discussed
- Assumption that site patterns represent broader regional norms

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 73 (Good for inductive). Pattern claims bounded by geography (60-79). Temporal boundaries clear (60-79). Sampling limitations acknowledged (60-79). Extrapolations to European patterns appropriately qualified (60-79). Regional constraints stated. Would need explicit transfer condition discussion for 80-100.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Strong

The paper demonstrates consistently strong evidential credibility across all four signals, with scores ranging from 73-81. Validity achieves Excellent band (81), reflecting the substantial evidence base of 135 individuals across 8 sites and systematic temporal transect sampling. All other signals fall in the Good band (73-77).

### Pattern Summary

The evidential foundation is characterised by:
1. Multi-proxy methodological triangulation providing convergent evidence
2. Substantial sample size for ancient DNA study (135 individuals)
3. Systematic temporal coverage through transect sampling design
4. Appropriate geographic and temporal scoping of claims
5. Grounding in established reference populations and analytical frameworks

Minor weaknesses in explicit sensitivity analysis and transfer condition specification do not undermine overall credibility.

### Implications for Cluster 3

- **For Reproducibility:** Strong evidential base underscores importance of analytical reproducibility. Data archived in ENA enables independent verification. Multi-proxy methods require access to documented software packages, all of which are published and open-source.
