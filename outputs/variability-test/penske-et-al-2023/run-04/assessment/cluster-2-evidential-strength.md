## Signal 3: Plausibility (79 - Good)

Research question addresses significant gap in understanding farmer-pastoralist interactions. Well-grounded in archaeogenetic literature.

## Signal 4: Validity (81 - Excellent)

Large sample (135 individuals, 113 dates). Multiple complementary statistical methods. Rigorous quality control procedures.

## Signal 5: Robustness (74 - Good)

Consistent findings across analytical approaches. Distal and proximal modelling both tested. Some model-dependence in ancestry estimates.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (71 - Good)

Results specific to Black Sea contact zone. Implications for broader steppe expansion discussed with appropriate caution.
