  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper uses archaeogenomic methods to investigate substantive research questions about population dynamics and genetic contact between late farming and pastoralist societies in southeastern Europe (~5400-2400 BC). Claims describe phenomena (genetic continuity, ancestry patterns, admixture timing). Methods (ancient DNA extraction, PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD, ROH) are analytical tools for investigating archaeological/anthropological questions, not the subject of investigation. Primary contribution is understanding population history and cultural contact in the Carpathian Basin and Lower Danube, not presenting methods.",

Research design frames study as addressing a 'sampling gap' without pre-specified hypotheses. Methods are applied for exploration (PCA projection, ancestry modelling, relatedness detection) rather than hypothesis testing. Claims describe discovered patterns (ancestry proportions, admixture timing, genetic continuity) rather than testing predictions. The major finding - contact occurred ~1000 years earlier than archaeological evidence suggested - clearly emerged from analysis rather than confirming a pre-specified prediction. Methodological transparency is high."

    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly inductive empirical research. The paper explicitly adopts an exploratory framework to address a temporal-spatial 'sampling gap' in archaeogenomics of southeastern Europe. No hypotheses are pre-specified; instead, the study characterises genetic variation across 135 individuals from 8 sites spanning ~3000 years, identifies ancestry patterns, and reconstructs population history from genomic data. Claims are pattern descriptions (ancestry proportions, genetic clusters, admixture timing, relatedness networks) emerging from multi-proxy statistical analyses (PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD, ROH, DATES). The major finding - that genetic contact between farming and pastoralist groups occurred ~1000 years earlier than archaeological evidence indicated - emerged from analysis as a discovery rather than confirming a pre-specified prediction. Revealed approach matches expressed approach. Classification is unambiguous."

Supplementary materials provide detailed data tables (A-Y) and Extended Data Figures. DNA sequences deposited to ENA (PRJEB62503). Research framework clearly described as archaeogenomic reconstruction of population dynamics. Transparency is excellent for Nature article."

Validity and Reproducibility important secondary signals given reliance on established computational methods and publicly archived sequence data (ENA PRJEB62503, FAIR score 14/15)."

  "classification_notes": "Straightforward empirical-inductive archaeogenomics study with excellent taxonomy fit. High transparency through Nature publication standards and comprehensive supplementary materials. FAIR score 14/15 (93.3%) indicates excellent reproducibility infrastructure with ENA data deposition. Only gaps: no explicit data licence and no custom code repository (relies on published software packages). The 4 research designs, 19 methods, and 24 protocols provide comprehensive methodological documentation rare outside genomics fields."
