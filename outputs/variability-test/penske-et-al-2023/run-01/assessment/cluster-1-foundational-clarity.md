## Signal 1: Comprehensibility (82 - Excellent)

Clear logical progression from research question through genetic analyses to conclusions. Technical terminology (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm) appropriately explained. Main findings stated explicitly in abstract with quantified claims. Results organised by time period (CA, Eneolithic, EBA) aids reader comprehension.

## Signal 2: Transparency (79 - Good)

Detailed Methods section with software versions and parameters. Data deposited in European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB62503). Strong documentation of laboratory protocols and quality control procedures. Limitations acknowledged (freshwater reservoir effect on 14C dates). Minor gaps: some model selection criteria implicit, reference population selection rationale not fully documented.
