## Executive Summary

This paper uses genome-wide ancient DNA data from 135 individuals spanning 5400-2400 BC to demonstrate early genetic contact between Copper Age farming groups and Eneolithic steppe populations in the northwestern Black Sea region, approximately 1,000 years earlier than previously documented. The study employs multiple complementary genetic analyses to trace admixture patterns across the critical transitional period.

**Overall Credibility:** Good (78/100)

## Cluster Summaries

### Cluster 1: Foundational Clarity (Strong)

Excellent comprehensibility with clear logical structure and well-explained technical methods. Good transparency through detailed Methods section and data deposition. Minor gaps in model selection documentation.

### Cluster 2: Evidential Strength (Strong)

Excellent validity through large dataset and multiple complementary analytical methods. Strong plausibility grounded in existing literature. Good robustness through multiple statistical approaches. Generalisability appropriately bounded to study region.

### Cluster 3: Reproducibility (Adequate)

Good reproducibility enabled by data availability via ENA. Established software tools with version numbers. Code not shared. Some procedural steps implicit.

## Key Strengths

1. **Large, well-documented dataset** - 135 individuals with 113 new radiocarbon dates
2. **Multiple analytical methods** - PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH provide triangulation
3. **Strong data availability** - Sequence data deposited in European Nucleotide Archive
4. **Rigorous quality control** - Contamination assessment and sample exclusion criteria

## Key Limitations

1. **Code not shared** - Analysis scripts not available for reproduction
2. **Single study region** - Results specific to Black Sea contact zone
3. **Some implicit procedures** - Model selection and population grouping criteria undocumented
4. **Freshwater reservoir effect** - Some dates may be affected by dietary factors

## Assessment Verdict

**Verdict:** Good

This paper demonstrates strong credibility through large-scale data collection, rigorous analytical methods, and transparent data sharing. The findings about early farmer-pastoralist contact are well-supported by multiple lines of genetic evidence. Primary limitations relate to analytical reproducibility (no code sharing) and geographic scope.
