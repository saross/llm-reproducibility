## Signal 3: Plausibility (80 - Excellent)

Well-grounded in existing archaeogenetic literature. Research question motivated by gap between CA farming collapse and Yamnaya expansion. Multiple lines of genetic evidence converge on same conclusions. Archaeological context integrated throughout.

## Signal 4: Validity (83 - Excellent)

Large dataset (135 individuals) with robust sampling across sites and time periods. Multiple complementary analytical methods (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH) triangulate findings. Contamination controls appropriate. 113 new radiocarbon dates strengthen chronological framework.

## Signal 5: Robustness (75 - Good)

Multiple statistical tests applied with consistent results. Distal and proximal qpAdm models tested for robustness. Some sensitivity to model assumptions (outgroup selection, source populations). Limited exploration of alternative interpretations.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (72 - Good)

Findings specific to Black Sea contact zone but implications for broader Yamnaya expansion discussed. Comparison to other European regions provided. Claims appropriately bounded to study region and time period. Single study area limits broader application.
