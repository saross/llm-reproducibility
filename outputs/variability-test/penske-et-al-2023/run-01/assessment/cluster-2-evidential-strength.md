## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** deductive

### Assessment

The paper's hypotheses and interpretations are well grounded in established population genetics theory and archaeological frameworks. The central hypothesis—that genetic contact between farming and steppe populations preceded the Yamnaya expansion—is consistent with accumulating evidence from other archaeogenetic studies in the broader region. The methodological framework draws on established ADMIXTOOLS approaches with documented statistical thresholds (P > 0.05 for qpAdm models).

Claims about genetic continuity between Neolithic and Copper Age groups, and about admixture signatures indicating steppe ancestry, are consistent with regional archaeological and genetic frameworks. The paper explicitly engages with competing interpretations, using multiple analytical approaches (PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD) to test the consistency of findings.

Anomalous results, such as variation in admixture proportions between sites and individuals, are acknowledged and contextualised within the framework of expected biological and social variation rather than being dismissed. The theoretical framework connecting genetic signatures to population movement and admixture is standard in archaeogenetics and requires no implausible auxiliary assumptions.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- Claims grounded in established ADMIXTOOLS framework with documented P-value thresholds
- Multiple complementary methods (PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD, ROH) provide convergent evidence
- Interpretations consistent with regional archaeological chronology and cultural sequences
- RD002: Longitudinal design provides chronological control for tracking genetic change

**Weaknesses:**
- Some interpretive links between genetic signatures and cultural processes require auxiliary archaeological assumptions

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 80 (Excellent for deductive) reflects: hypotheses grounded in established population genetics theory; predictions consistent with domain knowledge from both genetics and archaeology; anomalous results acknowledged and explained; theoretical framework coherent and standard for the field; no implausible auxiliary assumptions required for main conclusions.

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 78/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** deductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good validity with evidence that directly addresses the central hypothesis about early genetic contact. The sample of 135 successfully sequenced individuals from 216 attempted (62.5% success rate) provides an adequate empirical base for the claims made. The temporal range (5400-2400 BC) and spatial coverage (8 sites across SE Europe and the Black Sea region) are appropriate for testing hypotheses about regional genetic contact.

Methods are well-matched to research questions. PCA and qpAdm ancestry modelling are standard approaches for investigating population structure and admixture in ancient DNA data. The use of established reference datasets (Allen Ancient DNA Resource, modern West Eurasian populations) enables meaningful comparative analysis. Quality control procedures (SNP coverage thresholds, contamination estimation, DNA damage pattern analysis) ensure data reliability.

Alternative explanations are considered, with the paper testing multiple ancestry models and explicitly discussing which fit the data. The statistical framework (P > 0.05 threshold) provides clear criteria for model acceptance. Limitations are acknowledged, including constraints on temporal resolution and the challenges of inferring social processes from genetic data.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- M003: "All samples were enriched for a panel of 1.24 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms" — Appropriate methodological scale
- M005: "Ancestry modelling and ancestry proportion estimation on the 1,240,000 SNP dataset was performed using qpAdm in ADMIXTOOLS (v.5.1)" — Standard, validated methods
- 135 individuals across 3000-year timespan — Adequate sample for temporal claims
- 67 evidence items extracted supporting 60 claims — Strong evidence-claim ratio

**Weaknesses:**
- Sample sizes at individual sites vary considerably, limiting site-specific conclusions
- Some temporal periods represented by few individuals

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 78 (Good for deductive) reflects: evidence directly addresses hypothesis (meets 60-79 criterion); sample adequate for population-level claims though not for all site-level claims; methods appropriate and well-validated; alternative hypotheses tested through multiple models; major confounds addressed through quality control; limitations acknowledged. Does not reach 80-100 due to uneven temporal/spatial sampling.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 75/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** deductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good robustness through methodological triangulation. Results are tested using multiple independent analytical approaches: PCA for population structure visualisation, qpAdm for formal ancestry modelling, f-statistics for population relationships, IBD analysis for recent shared ancestry, ROH for inbreeding patterns, and DATES for admixture timing. The convergence of findings across these methods strengthens confidence in the main conclusions.

The paper uses explicit quality thresholds that enable sensitivity assessment: SNP coverage >400K for ROH analysis, >550K for IBD analysis. The use of different reference population sets in qpAdm modelling (documented in supplementary materials) provides some assessment of model dependency, though this is not extensively discussed in the main text.

Some robustness limitations exist. The paper does not report formal sensitivity analyses for qpAdm parameter choices. The dependence of ancestry modelling on choice of reference ("right") populations is acknowledged but not exhaustively tested. However, for archaeological DNA studies, the level of triangulation provided is above average.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- Multiple independent methods (PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD, ROH, DATES) with convergent results
- Explicit quality thresholds documented (SNP coverage requirements)
- M004: PCA and M005: qpAdm provide complementary perspectives on population structure
- Different analytical frameworks (population genetics vs. individual-level analysis) both support conclusions

**Weaknesses:**
- No formal sensitivity analysis for qpAdm parameter choices reported
- Dependence on reference population selection acknowledged but not exhaustively tested

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 75 (Good for deductive) reflects: some sensitivity analysis through methodological triangulation; results appear robust across multiple analytical approaches; some alternatives tested via different methods; assumptions stated (e.g., quality thresholds); dependencies documented (software versions). Does not reach 80-100 due to absence of formal parameter sensitivity analysis.

## Signal 7: Generalisability

**Score:** 76/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** deductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good attention to scope and generalisability constraints. Claims are explicitly bounded by geography (southeastern Europe and northwestern Black Sea region), chronology (5400-2400 BC), and the specific populations sampled. The paper is careful not to over-generalise from the 8 sampled sites to the entire region, and temporal claims are constrained to the periods with adequate sample representation.

Limitations to external validity are clearly stated. The paper acknowledges that genetic patterns observed in this study may not apply to unsurveyed regions or populations. The relationship between genetic signatures and cultural/social processes is discussed with appropriate caveats about the limits of inference from genetic data alone.

Transfer conditions for applying findings to other contexts are implicitly specified through the methodological framework: similar studies using the same analytical approaches (qpAdm, f-statistics) with comparable datasets could test whether patterns observed here generalise to other contact zones. The integration with AADR facilitates such comparative work.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- Geographic scope clearly bounded: "southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region"
- Temporal scope clearly bounded: "5400-2400 BC"
- RD003: Spatial design explicitly focuses on "contact zone" rather than claiming regional coverage
- Claims about individual sites appropriately scoped to available samples

**Weaknesses:**
- Uneven site representation limits generalisability across the full region
- Some extrapolation from genetic patterns to population processes involves interpretive assumptions

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 76 (Good for deductive) reflects: hypothesis scope stated with clear geographic and temporal bounds; main limitations acknowledged; bounds mostly clear with explicit constraint to sampled populations; extrapolations qualified (e.g., genetic patterns vs. social processes); some generalisability discussion in archaeological context. Does not reach 80-100 due to limited explicit discussion of transfer conditions to other regions.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Strong

The paper demonstrates strong evidential strength across all four credibility signals. Scores are consistent (75-80 range) indicating a balanced study without major credibility gaps. The highest score is for Plausibility (80), reflecting the strong grounding in established archaeogenetic theory and methods. The lowest is Robustness (75), reflecting the absence of formal sensitivity analyses despite good methodological triangulation.

### Pattern Summary

The overall pattern is one of methodologically sound archaeogenetic research following established field standards. The study benefits from: (1) a clear theoretical framework that generates testable predictions, (2) appropriate and well-documented methods, (3) adequate sample sizes for population-level conclusions, and (4) appropriate scope constraints. The main credibility limitation is the dependence of some conclusions on analytical choices (reference populations, quality thresholds) that are not exhaustively sensitivity-tested.

### Implications for Cluster 3

- **For Reproducibility:** The strong methodological documentation and data sharing (Cluster 1 Transparency score 78) combined with good validity and robustness scores suggest that technical reproduction of the main findings should be feasible. However, the absence of code repositories (noted in Cluster 1) may complicate exact analytical reproduction. The robustness score (75) suggests that conclusions should be robust to reasonable analytical variations, increasing confidence that reproduction attempts would yield similar results.
