## Executive Summary

This archaeogenetics paper analyses genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals to demonstrate genetic contact between Copper Age farming groups and Eneolithic steppe populations approximately 1,000 years earlier than previously documented. The study uses multiple genetic analyses including PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, and IBD to characterise this contact zone.

**Overall Credibility:** Good (77/100)

## Cluster Summaries

### Cluster 1: Foundational Clarity (Strong)

Excellent comprehensibility with clear logical structure. Good transparency through detailed Methods and data deposition.

### Cluster 2: Evidential Strength (Strong)

Excellent validity through large dataset and multiple methods. Good plausibility, robustness, and generalisability with appropriate scope limitations.

### Cluster 3: Reproducibility (Adequate)

Good reproducibility enabled by data availability. Code not shared. Some analytical procedures implicit.

## Key Strengths

1. **Large, well-dated dataset** - 135 individuals with 113 radiocarbon dates
2. **Multiple complementary methods** - PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH
3. **Data publicly available** - ENA repository
4. **Rigorous quality control** - Contamination assessment and exclusion

## Key Limitations

1. **No code sharing** - Analysis scripts unavailable
2. **Regional scope** - Results specific to study area
3. **Implicit model selection** - Some analytical choices undocumented
4. **Radiocarbon reservoir effects** - Potential dating complications
