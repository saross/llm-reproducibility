  "paper_type_justification": "This paper collects and analyses new empirical data (genome-wide ancient DNA from 135 individuals) to investigate phenomena in the world (genetic contact between farming and pastoralist populations in southeastern Europe during the 4th-3rd millennium BC). Claims describe and explain genetic patterns and population history. Methods (aDNA extraction, PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD) are tools used to investigate population dynamics, not the subjects being investigated. Primary contribution is understanding the origins and formation of Yamnaya pastoralists through genetic evidence.",

      "claims_structure": "Claims are predominantly pattern descriptions and interpretive explanations. C01: 'transfer of critical innovations between farmers and transitional foragers/herders'. C02: 'groups from the northwestern Black Sea region carried varying amounts of mixed ancestries'. Claims describe observed genetic patterns and propose explanatory narratives - not hypothesis tests with confirmatory/rejection outcomes.",
      "methods_application": "Methods are applied for pattern documentation: PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualisation of genetic structure, f-statistics for pairwise genetic comparisons, qpAdm for ancestry modelling. Methods explore data systematically rather than testing pre-specified predictions. Multiple competing models are fitted to find best-fitting explanations.",

The revealed methodology matches: systematic genetic documentation followed by pattern-based interpretation. No post-hoc hypothesis framing detected. The interpretive claims in the Discussion flow naturally from the documented patterns."

  "primary_classification": {
    "approach": "inductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly inductive archaeogenomics research. The study systematically collects genome-wide data from 135 ancient individuals across multiple sites and time periods to document genetic patterns and population dynamics. No a priori hypotheses are stated; instead, the research explores genetic variation, identifies ancestry patterns through PCA and admixture modelling, and develops interpretive narratives connecting genetic evidence to archaeological processes. The workflow follows an inductive sequence: data collection → pattern identification → interpretation. While the Discussion includes abductive reasoning (inferring best explanations for observed patterns, particularly regarding Yamnaya formation), the primary research design is inductive pattern documentation. Classification confidence is high because the design, methods, and claims all consistently indicate exploratory/descriptive research."

Reproducibility supported by data deposition (ENA PRJEB62503) but code not shared. Robustness somewhat deemphasised as exploratory research - though multiple analytical approaches (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD) provide methodological triangulation."

Paper fits inductive category excellently. Some abductive reasoning in interpretation phase (comparing alternative ancestry models) but primary approach is clearly inductive pattern documentation.
