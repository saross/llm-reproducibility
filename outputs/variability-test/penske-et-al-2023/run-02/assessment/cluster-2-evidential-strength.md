## Signal 3: Plausibility (79 - Good)

Well-positioned within archaeogenetic literature. Research question addresses clear gap in understanding of pre-Yamnaya contact. Conclusions consistent with established genetic patterns and archaeological evidence.

## Signal 4: Validity (82 - Excellent)

Large dataset (135 individuals, 113 radiocarbon dates). Multiple complementary methods provide triangulation. Rigorous contamination controls. Appropriate statistical thresholds applied.

## Signal 5: Robustness (74 - Good)

Multiple analytical approaches yield consistent results. Distal and proximal qpAdm models tested. Some model sensitivity to outgroup and source population choices.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (71 - Good)

Results specific to Black Sea contact zone. Implications for broader Yamnaya expansion discussed but require validation in other regions.
