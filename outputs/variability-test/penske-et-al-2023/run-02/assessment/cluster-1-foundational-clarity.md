## Signal 1: Comprehensibility (81 - Excellent)

Clear structure progressing from genetic data through analyses to conclusions. Technical methods explained with appropriate context. Main findings clearly stated with quantification. Logical organisation by time period.

## Signal 2: Transparency (78 - Good)

Detailed Methods with software versions. Data in ENA repository. Laboratory protocols documented. Some analytical choices (outgroup selection, model acceptance criteria) less fully documented.
