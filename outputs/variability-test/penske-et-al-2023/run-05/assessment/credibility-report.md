## Executive Summary

This archaeogenetics paper uses genome-wide ancient DNA from 135 individuals spanning 5400-2400 BC to demonstrate genetic contact between Copper Age farming groups and Eneolithic steppe populations approximately 1,000 years earlier than previously documented in the northwestern Black Sea contact zone.

**Overall Credibility:** Good (78/100)
