## Signal 3: Plausibility (80 - Excellent)

Well-grounded in archaeogenetic literature. Research question addresses important historical question. Conclusions consistent with archaeological evidence.

## Signal 4: Validity (82 - Excellent)

Large dataset (135 individuals, 113 radiocarbon dates). Multiple complementary methods. Rigorous contamination controls.

## Signal 5: Robustness (75 - Good)

Multiple statistical approaches yield consistent findings. Distal and proximal modelling tested. Some sensitivity to model assumptions.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (72 - Good)

Results specific to Black Sea contact zone. Broader implications discussed with appropriate caveats.
