## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 82/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The observed genetic patterns are highly consistent with established archaeogenomic and archaeological frameworks for southeastern European prehistory. The finding that Chalcolithic populations carry predominantly Anatolian Neolithic-related ancestry aligns with the well-documented demic diffusion model of Neolithic expansion into Europe. The paper's identification of genetic continuity between local Neolithic and Chalcolithic populations (single-source qpAdm models successful) is consistent with archaeological evidence for cultural continuity at tell settlements like Pietrele and Yunatsite.

The detection of early "steppe ancestry" in individual PIE060 (dated ~4700 BC) and later in Usatove/Mayaki populations (~3500 BC) fits the established timeline for early steppe-farmer interactions prior to the Yamnaya expansion. The observed Y-chromosomal haplogroup turnover (from diverse Neolithic lineages to R1b-Z2103 dominance) is consistent with patterns documented in Yamnaya-associated populations across Europe.

Anomalies are appropriately handled. The outlier individual PIE060 with elevated hunter-gatherer ancestry is explicitly acknowledged and analysed separately using DATES admixture timing. The freshwater reservoir effect potentially affecting radiocarbon dates is discussed as a limitation. The paper acknowledges uncertainty about whether observed genetic patterns at Yunatsite reflect indigenous resettlement or incoming populations.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**

- C007: "Using the respective, locally preceding, Neolithic groups for proximal qpAdm modelling, we could model all SEE CA groups as a single-source model" - Consistent with established Neolithic expansion framework
- C030: "Y-chromosomal haplogroup diversity decreased over time" - Consistent with documented Yamnaya-associated patterns
- Outlier PIE060 explicitly analysed with DATES; anomaly not ignored

**Weaknesses:**

- Some interpretive steps linking genetic patterns to social processes (e.g., "resettlement" vs "incoming groups") involve assumptions not fully explicated

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 82 reflects excellent plausibility for inductive research. Observed patterns are consistent with known regional/chronological frameworks (80-100 criterion), typologies follow established archaeogenomic conventions (80-100), anomalies are acknowledged and contextualised (80-100), and interpretations are grounded in extensive comparative data from published Neolithic and Bronze Age populations. Minor gap: some social-process interpretations involve implicit auxiliary assumptions.

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 78/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The data is sufficient and representative for the main pattern claims. The sample of 135 newly reported ancient individuals from 8 sites across southeastern Europe provides adequate coverage for characterising Chalcolithic genetic ancestry profiles. Sampling is systematic: petrous bone sampling following established protocols (protocols.io), with quality thresholds applied (>50,000 SNPs for most analyses, >400,000 for ROH, >600,000 for IBD).

Methods are appropriate for the exploratory research goals. PCA projection onto West Eurasian genetic variation provides standard population structure visualisation. qpAdm ancestry modelling with rotating outgroups is the current standard for ancient DNA ancestry composition. f-statistics tests are appropriate for genetic affinity assessment. IBD and ROH analyses address biological relatedness and inbreeding patterns.

Alternative interpretations are considered. For ancestry composition, both distal and proximal qpAdm models are tested to evaluate local vs regional source populations. For individual outlier PIE060, alternative source populations are systematically evaluated. The paper acknowledges that genetic patterns may reflect demographic processes that could be interpreted multiple ways.

Coverage limitations are acknowledged. Some sites have small sample sizes (e.g., Varna I has archaeological significance but limited genetic sampling). Temporal gaps exist between Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age samples at some sites.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**

- E001-E067: 67 evidence items capturing extensive empirical data from 135 individuals
- M001-M016: 16 methods systematically documented with quality thresholds
- RD002: "Temporal transect design" allows diachronic pattern assessment
- Both distal and proximal qpAdm models tested

**Weaknesses:**

- Some sites have limited sample sizes constraining pattern resolution
- Temporal discontinuities at certain sites

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 78 reflects good validity for inductive research. Data is sufficient for main pattern claims (60-79, approaching 80-100), sampling is systematic with documented quality thresholds (60-79, strong), coverage is adequate for regional patterns (60-79), some alternatives are considered through multiple modelling approaches (60-79), and limitations are acknowledged (60-79). Not rated higher because sample sizes at some individual sites are limited.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 75/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The paper demonstrates good methodological triangulation across multiple analytical approaches. Genetic ancestry patterns are assessed using complementary methods: PCA for population structure visualisation, qpAdm for formal ancestry modelling, and f-statistics for genetic affinity testing. These independent approaches provide convergent evidence for the main findings.

For ancestry modelling, robustness is tested through both distal (Turkey_N, CHG, EHG, WHG) and proximal (local Neolithic sources) qpAdm frameworks. The paper explicitly tests whether models pass formal qpAdm admixture tests (p > 0.05 threshold). Rotating outgroup strategies reduce dependence on specific reference population choices.

Pattern identification is corroborated across multiple genetic systems. Autosomal ancestry patterns are complemented by Y-chromosome haplogroup analysis, IBD sharing analysis for biological relatedness, and ROH analysis for inbreeding levels. This multi-proxy approach provides robustness through independent data sources.

Some analytical choices lack sensitivity testing. The specific qpAdm outgroup sets, while justified, are not systematically varied to test stability. The paper does not report inter-observer reliability for sample selection or classification decisions. Parameter sensitivity for GLIMPSE imputation and DATES admixture timing is not explicitly evaluated.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**

- RD004: "Multi-proxy genetic analysis" provides convergent evidence across independent methods
- Both distal and proximal qpAdm models provide methodological triangulation
- Autosomal, Y-chromosome, IBD, and ROH analyses corroborate patterns

**Weaknesses:**

- No systematic sensitivity analysis of outgroup set choices
- Parameter sensitivity for imputation and admixture timing not reported
- No inter-observer reliability assessment

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 75 reflects good robustness for inductive research. Methodological triangulation is present across multiple genetic approaches (60-79), main patterns appear robust to different modelling frameworks (60-79), and convergent evidence comes from multiple data types (60-79). Does not reach 80-100 because systematic sensitivity analysis of analytical choices is limited, and inter-observer reliability is not assessed.

## Signal 7: Generalisability

**Score:** 72/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Pattern claims are appropriately bounded by geography, chronology, and context. The paper explicitly focuses on southeastern Europe (Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) during the Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age transition (5400-2400 BC). Claims about genetic ancestry patterns are scoped to this region and period rather than extrapolated broadly to "European prehistory."

Sampling limitations are acknowledged. The paper notes that samples come from 8 sites and that patterns at individual sites may not represent broader regional variation. The temporal discontinuities between Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age samples at some locations are discussed. The limitations of ancient DNA preservation affecting sample recovery are implicit but acknowledged through quality threshold reporting.

Extrapolations are generally qualified. The paper uses language like "suggest," "consistent with," and "indicates" rather than claiming definitive causation. Conclusions about population dynamics are framed as hypotheses for future testing rather than established facts.

Transfer conditions are partially addressed. The paper discusses how findings relate to patterns observed in adjacent regions (steppe populations, Anatolia, central Europe) but does not explicitly specify conditions under which southeastern European patterns would or would not generalise to other regions.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**

- Claims explicitly bounded to southeastern Europe, 5400-2400 BC
- C063: "Southeastern European populations maintained genetic continuity with preceding Neolithic populations" - Appropriately scoped
- Sampling limitations acknowledged (site-specific patterns, temporal gaps)

**Weaknesses:**

- Transfer conditions to adjacent regions not fully specified
- Regional heterogeneity within southeastern Europe not systematically assessed

### Scoring Rationale

Score of 72 reflects good generalisability for inductive research. Pattern claims are bounded geographically and temporally (60-79), sampling limitations are acknowledged (60-79), scope is generally matched to coverage (60-79), and extrapolations are qualified (60-79). Does not reach 80-100 because transfer conditions to other regions are not explicitly specified, and within-region heterogeneity assessment is limited.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Strong

This archaeogenomic study demonstrates strong evidential strength across all four credibility signals. The findings are highly plausible given established frameworks for European prehistory, with genetic ancestry patterns aligning well with archaeological and previous archaeogenomic evidence. Validity is good, with sufficient and representative sampling, appropriate methods, and acknowledged limitations. Robustness is supported by multi-proxy triangulation across autosomal, Y-chromosome, and kinship analyses, though systematic sensitivity testing is limited. Generalisability is appropriately constrained to the southeastern European Chalcolithic-Bronze Age context.

### Pattern Summary

The four signals show consistent strength without major divergences. Plausibility is highest (82) reflecting the paper's strong grounding in established regional frameworks. Validity, Robustness, and Generalisability cluster in the Good band (72-78), reflecting solid but not exceptional performance on evidence sufficiency, analytical triangulation, and scope constraints. The pattern suggests a well-executed exploratory study that meets genre expectations for inductive archaeogenomics.

### Implications for Cluster 3

- **For Reproducibility:** Strong evidential strength supports high reproducibility expectations. Data availability (ENA PRJEB62503) enables computational reproduction. Well-documented methods with parameter specifications facilitate analytical reproduction. The lack of custom code repository is the main reproducibility limitation, though established software packages are comprehensively cited.
