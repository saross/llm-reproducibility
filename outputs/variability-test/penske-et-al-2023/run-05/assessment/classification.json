  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper collects and analyses new empirical data about ancient human populations in southeastern Europe. The research question targets phenomena (genetic ancestry, population movements, social dynamics) rather than methods. Claims describe and explain patterns in human genetic variation and population history. Methods (ancient DNA extraction, 1,240,000 SNP capture, qpAdm modelling, f-statistics, IBD analysis) are tools used to investigate these phenomena, not the subject of investigation. Primary contribution is understanding early contact between farming and pastoralist societies, not presenting a methodology.",

Claims characterise genetic ancestry profiles and population relationships discovered through analysis rather than testing pre-specified predictions.",

Each analytical layer builds on discovered patterns to characterise genetic landscape. No hypothesis → test → confirmation sequence."

    "justification": "This is clearly inductive research. The paper systematically characterises genetic ancestry of ancient southeastern European populations without pre-specified hypotheses. Methods (qpAdm ancestry modelling, PCA, f-statistics, IBD analysis) are applied comprehensively to discover and document population structure. Claims describe observed patterns (ancestry profiles, kinship networks, haplogroup distributions) rather than test predictions. The analytical workflow follows inductive sequence: generate genetic data → identify patterns → interpret population history. No confirmatory framework; research aims to characterise previously unknown genetic variation. Classification is unambiguous."
