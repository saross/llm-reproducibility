## Signal 3: Plausibility

**Score:** 78/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

The observed patterns are generally consistent with established archaeogenomic and archaeological frameworks for southeastern Europe. The finding of genetic continuity between Neolithic and Copper Age groups aligns with existing models of Anatolian farmer ancestry persistence. The detection of early steppe-related ancestry admixture (~1000 years earlier than previously anticipated) challenges but does not contradict established frameworks — rather, it refines temporal understanding.

Classifications follow established conventions (Neolithic, Copper Age, Eneolithic, EBA chronological designations; standard ancestry components like Anatolian_N, WHG, EHG, CHG). The paper acknowledges anomalies: limited steppe ancestry in some CA individuals despite later periods showing higher proportions, suggesting complex admixture dynamics.

Interpretations are grounded in comparative genetic data from published reference populations. The use of qpAdm modelling with established outgroups provides theoretical grounding. Minor tensions exist with some prior assumptions about the timing and nature of steppe-farmer contact.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- C003: "Genetic continuity existed between Neolithic and Copper Age groups in SEE" — consistent with established Anatolian farmer persistence models
- C001: "Early contact occurred ~1000 years earlier than anticipated" — refines rather than contradicts existing frameworks
- RD002: Multi-proxy ancestry modelling combines PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm with established reference populations

**Weaknesses:**
- Some implicit assumptions about population continuity and replacement models (IA001-IA010) not fully tested against alternatives
- "Earlier than anticipated" framing relies on prior models that may have been underdetermined

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 78 (Good for inductive). Patterns generally consistent with known frameworks (60-79). Classifications follow established conventions (60-79). Major anomalies addressed, though some tensions remain with prior models (60-79). Interpretations have strong comparative genetic basis. Slight reduction for implicit assumptions about population dynamics.

## Signal 4: Validity

**Score:** 80/100 (Excellent)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Evidence is sufficient and representative for the pattern claims made. The dataset of 135 successfully analysed ancient individuals from 8 distinct sites across 4 chronological periods (Neolithic, CA, Eneolithic, EBA) provides substantial coverage for regional pattern claims. Sampling is systematic through the temporal transect design (RD003), targeting key transition periods.

Methods are appropriate for archaeogenomic population history reconstruction. The multi-proxy analytical approach (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH) provides convergent evidence for ancestry patterns. Alternative interpretations are considered implicitly through multiple modelling approaches (proximal vs distal qpAdm).

Coverage is adequate for southeastern Europe/northwestern Black Sea region, though concentrated at specific sites. Claims are generally scoped to evidence: regional ancestry patterns are claimed, not pan-European generalisations. Limitations are acknowledged regarding temporal gaps and geographic coverage constraints.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- E007: 135 individuals successfully analysed from 216 attempted — substantial sample size for ancient DNA
- RD003: Temporal transect sampling across Neolithic-EBA provides chronological coverage
- RD004: Comparative site analysis with IBD assessment addresses population structure

**Weaknesses:**
- Site selection may privilege better-preserved contexts, potentially biasing toward certain burial practices
- Some temporal periods better represented than others (CA n=95 vs Neolithic n=1)

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 80 (Excellent for inductive). Data sufficient and representative for regional pattern claims (80-100). Sampling systematic through temporal transect design (80-100). Coverage adequate with 8 sites and 4 periods (80-100). Alternative approaches considered through multi-proxy methods (80-100). Limitations acknowledged (80-100). Claims scoped appropriately to southeastern Europe/Black Sea region.

## Signal 5: Robustness

**Score:** 75/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Pattern identification demonstrates good methodological triangulation. Multiple analytical methods (PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH) provide convergent evidence for ancestry patterns. The use of both proximal and distal qpAdm models tests sensitivity to reference population choices.

Classification schemes are consistent with established archaeogenomic conventions. The paper uses standard ancestry components and chronological designations, ensuring comparability with other studies. Inter-laboratory reliability is partially addressed through adherence to established ancient DNA protocols.

Sampling sensitivity is partially documented: the analysis of 135/216 attempted individuals acknowledges DNA preservation bias. However, systematic assessment of how results might vary with different site selection or temporal binning is limited. Some patterns (particularly early steppe admixture timing) could be sensitive to reference population choices.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- RD002: Multi-proxy approach combining PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm provides triangulation
- M005-M006: Both proximal and distal qpAdm modelling tests reference population sensitivity
- M007-M008: IBD and ROH provide independent relatedness evidence

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited explicit sensitivity analysis of ancestry proportion estimates
- Results may be sensitive to reference population composition (not fully tested)
- No formal inter-coder reliability assessment for archaeological context assignments

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 75 (Good for inductive). Some methodological triangulation present (60-79). Main patterns robust across multiple methods (60-79). Standard classification schemes ensure consistency (60-79). Sampling sensitivity mentioned but not systematically tested (60-79). Some convergent evidence from multiple analytical approaches. Would need explicit sensitivity analyses for 80-100 band.

## Signal 7: Generalisability

**Score:** 72/100 (Good)

**Approach anchors applied:** inductive

### Assessment

Pattern claims are appropriately bounded by geography and chronology. Claims explicitly pertain to southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region during 5400-2400 BC. The paper does not make universal claims about European population history from this regional dataset.

Sampling limitations are acknowledged: the study covers specific sites and may not capture full regional variation. Temporal gaps (particularly limited Neolithic representation) are implicitly acknowledged through sample counts. Extrapolations to broader European patterns are qualified and contextualised within published comparative studies.

Transfer conditions are partially specified: findings about early steppe-farmer contact are explicitly framed as relevant to the "contact zone" between farming societies and incoming pastoralists. The paper acknowledges that patterns observed here may not generalise to all regions of Europe.

### Evidence

**Strengths:**
- RD001: Explicit geographic bounding to "southeastern Europe and the northwestern Black Sea region"
- C001: Claims bounded to "this critical time period" (5400-2400 BC)
- E001: Sample coverage (8 sites) explicitly documented with geographic coordinates

**Weaknesses:**
- Some implicit assumption that observed patterns represent regional norms rather than site-specific anomalies
- Transfer to other contact zones (e.g., central Europe, Balkans) not explicitly discussed

### Scoring Rationale

Score: 72 (Good for inductive). Pattern claims bounded by geography and chronology (60-79). Sampling limitations acknowledged (60-79). Scope generally matched to coverage (60-79). Extrapolations qualified (60-79). Regional/contextual constraints stated (60-79). Would need more explicit transfer condition discussion for 80-100.

## Cluster Synthesis

**Overall Evidential Strength:** Strong

The paper demonstrates strong credibility across all four signals, with scores ranging from 72-80. Validity scores highest (80) reflecting comprehensive evidence base and systematic sampling. All signals fall in Good to Excellent bands for inductive research.

### Pattern Summary

Consistent strength across credibility dimensions. The paper's multi-proxy analytical approach provides convergent evidence for major claims. Evidence is sufficient for regional pattern claims, with appropriate geographic and temporal bounding. Minor weaknesses in explicit sensitivity analysis and transfer condition specification do not undermine overall credibility.

### Implications for Cluster 3

- **For Reproducibility:** Strong evidential base suggests analytical reproducibility is important. Data availability in ENA enables verification. Multi-proxy methods require access to multiple software tools but all are published packages.
