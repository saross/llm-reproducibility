## Signal 3: Plausibility (81 - Excellent)

Well-grounded in archaeogenetic literature. Research addresses clear gap in understanding. Conclusions consistent with archaeological evidence.

## Signal 4: Validity (84 - Excellent)

Large dataset with robust sampling. Multiple complementary methods. 113 new radiocarbon dates strengthen chronology. Rigorous contamination controls.

## Signal 5: Robustness (76 - Good)

Multiple statistical approaches yield consistent results. Sensitivity testing through distal/proximal modelling. Some sensitivity to model assumptions.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (73 - Good)

Results specific to Black Sea contact zone. Broader implications discussed with appropriate caveats. Single region limits generalisability.
