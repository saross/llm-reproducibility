## Signal 3: Plausibility (78 - Good)

Well-grounded in established archaeogenetic literature. Research question addresses significant historical gap in knowledge.

## Signal 4: Validity (80 - Excellent)

Large sample size (135 individuals). Multiple complementary statistical methods. Rigorous contamination controls and quality filtering.

## Signal 5: Robustness (73 - Good)

Multiple analytical approaches produce consistent findings. Distal and proximal qpAdm modelling tested. Some dependence on model assumptions.

## Signal 6: Generalisability (70 - Good)

Results geographically specific to Black Sea contact zone. Broader implications discussed with appropriate caveats.
