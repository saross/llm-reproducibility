  "paper_type": "empirical",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper uses archaeogenomic methods to investigate substantive research questions about population dynamics and genetic contact between farming and pastoralist societies in southeastern Europe. Claims describe phenomena (genetic continuity, ancestry patterns, admixture events). Methods (aDNA extraction, PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics) are tools for investigating archaeological/anthropological questions, not the subject of investigation. Primary contribution is understanding population history, not presenting methods. Research designs explicitly labelled 'empirical-inductive' in extraction.",

    "justification": "This is clearly inductive research. The paper explicitly adopts an exploratory framework, documented in RD001 as 'empirical-inductive'. No hypotheses are pre-specified; instead, the study characterises genetic variation, identifies ancestry patterns, and reconstructs population history from the genomic data. Claims are pattern descriptions (ancestry proportions, genetic clusters, admixture timing) emerging from multi-proxy statistical analyses (PCA, qpAdm, f-statistics, IBD). The major finding - that contact occurred ~1000 years earlier than anticipated - emerged from analysis rather than confirming a pre-specified prediction. Revealed approach matches expressed approach. Classification is unambiguous."

Validity and Reproducibility important secondary signals given reliance on computational methods and publicly archived data (ENA PRJEB62503)."
