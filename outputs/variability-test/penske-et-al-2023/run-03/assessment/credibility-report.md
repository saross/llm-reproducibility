## Cluster Summaries

### Cluster 1: Foundational Clarity (Strong)

Both signals reach Good-Excellent band. Clear presentation with detailed documentation.

### Cluster 2: Evidential Strength (Strong)

Excellent validity, good plausibility and robustness. Regional generalisability limitations acknowledged.

### Cluster 3: Reproducibility (Adequate)

Good reproducibility with data availability. Analytical code not shared.

---

## Key Strengths

1. **Large, well-dated dataset** - 135 individuals with 113 radiocarbon dates
2. **Multiple complementary methods** - PCA, f-statistics, qpAdm, IBD, ROH
3. **Strong data availability** - ENA repository (PRJEB62503)
4. **Rigorous quality control** - Contamination assessment and exclusion criteria

## Key Limitations

1. **Code not shared** - Analysis scripts unavailable
2. **Regional scope** - Results specific to study area
3. **Implicit model selection** - Some criteria undocumented
