  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_justification": "Primary contribution is the FAIMS Mobile platform for archaeological field data collection. Paper presents software capabilities, technical architecture, co-development model, and deployment strategies. The three case studies (Boncuklu, MEMSAP, PAZC) serve demonstrative/illustrative function to show platform features in use, not as primary contribution. Results section describes software deployment experiences, thematic observations about co-development process, and lessons learned - not substantive archaeological findings. Claims are about FAIMS capabilities and deployment model effectiveness ('co-development bridges off-the-shelf vs bespoke software', 'open-source sustainability model viable'), not about archaeological phenomena. This is a paper ABOUT a method (software tool), not a paper USING a method to study archaeological phenomena.",

  "methodological_characterisation": {
    "subtype": "software_tool",
    "validation_approach": "inductive",
    "validation_notes": "FAIMS capabilities validated through three descriptive case studies from archaeological fieldwork (Boncuklu Höyük in Turkey, MEMSAP in Malawi, PAZC in Peru). Case studies show software features and data collection workflows in practice through project director post-project reflections (questionnaires and communications). No formal hypothesis-testing of software performance, no systematic comparison with alternative tools, no benchmark testing against criteria. Validation is purely descriptive/demonstrative and retrospective - shows what the tool can do and reports user experiences. Thematic synthesis organises case study observations but does not constitute systematic evaluation."

    "confidence": "high",
    "significance": "Not problematic for methodological paper presenting software tool. Paper does not conduct formal research on FAIMS; paper presents FAIMS itself through stakeholder experiences. Methodological papers presenting software tools commonly use demonstrative case studies without formal research design frameworks. Absence of expressed methodology is genre-appropriate for this paper type."

    "approach": "inductive",

Claims describe software properties and development approach, not research findings about phenomena. Pattern descriptions emerge from case study observations rather than hypothesis tests.",
      "methods_application": "M001 (post-project questionnaire) and M002 (communication log analysis) are data collection for reflective practice, not systematic research methods. M-IMP-001 (theme identification) and M-IMP-002 (quote selection) are implicit qualitative analysis approaches. Methods gather experiences and illustrate features rather than test hypotheses about software performance.",

  "primary_classification": {
    "approach": "inductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "Classification based on validation approach, not empirical research approach. FAIMS validation is inductive/descriptive: software capabilities demonstrated through three illustrative case studies with retrospective project director reflections. Thematic synthesis organises observations into three themes (upfront costs vs backend payouts, importance of support, sustainability). No deductive hypothesis-testing of tool performance or abductive inference about design. Primary contribution is technical specification and descriptive demonstration of deployment experiences. Confidence is high because validation strategy is clear and appropriate for software tool paper, and the inductive nature of the case study analysis is unambiguous."

Validation approach (case study demonstration) is implicit rather than explicit - paper presents experiences without stating this is the validation strategy. Theme identification and quote selection methods are implicit (M-IMP-001, M-IMP-002). Moderate transparency for methodological paper - technical aspects clear but case study analysis methodology undocumented."

Primary signals: (1) Transparency of design decisions and technical architecture (FAIMS architecture well-documented, deployment options specified), (2) Reproducibility of software (GPLv3 open source, GitHub repository, module definition documents available), (3) Comprehensibility of technical specification (clear documentation of customisation hierarchy, deployment options). Validity and Plausibility apply to claims ABOUT the software and development model. Generalisability and Robustness of case studies deemphasised - three case studies are illustrative demonstrations, not meant to generalise beyond showing tool capabilities and stakeholder experiences."

  "classification_notes": "Software tool paper presenting FAIMS Mobile platform. Classification based on validation approach (inductive demonstration through retrospective case studies). Key characteristics: (1) Retrospective reflective practice account rather than prospective research study, (2) Case studies serve demonstrative not evidential function, (3) Thematic synthesis organises observations but lacks documented methodology, (4) Primary contribution is software and deployment model, not case study findings. Different signal priorities apply compared to empirical research papers. Potential undeclared conflict of interest noted in infrastructure extraction: three authors are FAIMS team members reporting on FAIMS software."
