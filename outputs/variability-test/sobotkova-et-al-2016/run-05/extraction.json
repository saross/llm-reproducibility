Its core claims about the benefits and challenges of generalised software co-development are well-supported by evidence from three independent case studies. The exceptional transparency of the FAIMS project (open source code, archived communications, shared modules) partially compensates for methodological limitations inherent in reflective case study approaches. The paper provides valuable practical guidance while honestly acknowledging trade-offs and failures. Credibility is good for its genre, though caution is warranted regarding sustainability claims and generalisability beyond FAIMS-supported projects."
