## Extraction Quality Evaluation

### Completeness Check

| Array | Count | Expected Range | Status |
|-------|-------|----------------|--------|
| Evidence | 35 | 25-45 | ✅ Within range |
| Claims | 50 | 45-70 | ✅ Within range |
| Implicit Arguments | 10 | 8-15 | ✅ Within range |
| Research Designs | 5 | 4-7 | ✅ Within range |
| Methods | 8 | 6-12 | ✅ Within range |
| Protocols | 14 | 8-18 | ✅ Within range |

### Source Verification

- **Verbatim quotes present:** 100% of explicit items
- **Trigger text present:** 100% of implicit items
- **Location data complete:** Yes
- **Cross-references verified:** Yes

### Known Limitations

1. Paper lacks DOI (book chapter format)
2. No ORCIDs provided for authors
3. No formal ethics or conflicts of interest statements
4. Thematic analysis coding procedure not described in detail

## Metric-Signal Alignment

### Available Metrics

| Metric Type | Coverage | Quality |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Cost data | Comprehensive | High - specific AUD figures with ranges |
| Time savings | Good | Specific hours/days comparisons |
| Deployment statistics | Good | 19 workflows, 17 projects, 11 field deployments |
| Infrastructure counts | Basic | Funding sources, repositories listed |

### Signal Alignment Matrix

| Signal | Metric Availability | Assessment Viability |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensibility | Moderate | Structure clear, terminology defined |
| Transparency | Good | Methods described, supplementary materials available |
| Plausibility | Good | Cost-benefit claims supported by data |
| Validity | Moderate | Case study approach documented but selection criteria limited |
| Robustness | Limited | Three case studies only, no sensitivity analysis |
| Generalisability | Limited | Explicitly acknowledged limitation to FAIMS context |
| Reproducibility | Good | Software available, documentation referenced |

---

## Classification Confidence

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Paper type clarity | High - clearly methodological |
| Approach identification | High - inductive from case studies |
| Expressed/revealed alignment | Aligned - no HARKing indicators |
| Mixed methods integration | Moderate - quantitative supports qualitative |

---

## Quality State Determination

### Decision Logic

1. **Extraction completeness:** All arrays within expected ranges ✅
2. **Source verification:** All items have verbatim quotes or trigger text ✅
3. **Classification confidence:** High for both paper type and approach ✅
4. **Metric coverage:** Sufficient for most signals ✅
5. **Known blockers:** None identified ✅

### Quality State: **HIGH**

**Rationale:** The extraction is comprehensive with strong source verification. The paper type and research approach are clearly identifiable with high confidence. Sufficient metrics are available to assess most signals. No assessment blockers identified.

## Assessment Pathway

**Proceed to:** Full assessment with approach-specific anchors (inductive methodological paper)

**Scoring guidance:**
- Use inductive scoring anchors for all seven signals
- Apply methodological paper weighting (emphasis on Transparency and Comprehensibility)
- Note software/tool paper context when assessing Reproducibility

**Key considerations for assessment:**
1. Evaluate case study selection and representativeness
2. Consider potential conflicts of interest (authors include FAIMS team)
3. Assess transparency of thematic analysis procedure
4. Evaluate whether quantitative claims are adequately documented
