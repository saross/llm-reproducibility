  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_confidence": "high",
  "paper_type_justification": "This is a methodological paper documenting the development and deployment of the FAIMS mobile platform through three case studies. The paper's primary purpose is to derive lessons about software co-development rather than to report empirical archaeological findings. The paper evaluates a technological intervention and provides prescriptive guidance for future implementations.",

  "classification_justification": "Classified as methodological/inductive because: (1) Primary purpose is to derive lessons about software co-development from deployment experiences; (2) Three case studies serve as data for thematic synthesis rather than empirical hypothesis testing; (3) Conclusions offer prescriptive guidance for future practice; (4) Paper evaluates a technological intervention rather than reporting archaeological findings. The inductive approach is clearly revealed through the 'observations woven into themes' structure and the lack of pre-specified hypotheses.",
