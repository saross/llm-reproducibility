## Signal Assessments

### 1. Comprehensibility

**Definition:** How clear and understandable is the research design, methodology, and argumentation?

#### Inductive Anchors Applied

| Score Range | Description | Paper Alignment |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 80-100 | Methods and procedures fully explained, accessible to non-specialists | Partial fit |
| 60-79 | Core methods clear, some gaps in explanation | **Best fit** |
| 40-59 | Methods described but significant ambiguities | — |
| 20-39 | Limited explanation of key procedures | — |
| 0-19 | Opaque methodology | — |

#### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear explanation of FAIMS platform architecture and customisation options
- Well-structured thematic presentation (three themes with sub-sections)
- Technical terminology defined (e.g., "modules," "definition documents," "forking")
- Case study introductions provide adequate context
- Quotations from project directors illustrate key points effectively

**Weaknesses:**
- Thematic analysis procedure not explicitly described (how were themes identified?)
- Case study selection criteria not fully articulated
- Some technical details assume familiarity with software development concepts
- Quantitative comparisons (time savings) lack methodological detail

**Evidence:**
- E033: Communications available as supplementary material
- C032: "their complete, unedited communications with the FAIMS project are available via the digital supplement"
- E034: Four customisation methods clearly enumerated
- Implicit argument IA005 notes assumption that three case studies are sufficient

#### Score: **68/100**

**Justification:** The paper is generally well-written and accessible, with clear structure and good use of illustrative quotations. However, the analytical methodology (how themes emerged from data) is not explicitly described, and case study selection criteria are opaque. A non-specialist reader would understand the main arguments but might struggle with the basis for generalisations.

### 2. Transparency

**Definition:** How openly are methods, data, and analytical procedures disclosed?

#### Inductive Anchors Applied

| Score Range | Description | Paper Alignment |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 80-100 | Full workflow transparency, sampling documented, iterative process visible | Partial fit |
| 60-79 | Good disclosure of methods and data sources, some gaps | **Best fit** |
| 40-59 | Basic methods described, limited procedural detail | — |
| 20-39 | Methods mentioned but not documented | — |
| 0-19 | No methodological disclosure | — |

#### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Source materials explicitly listed (questionnaires, emails, chat messages)
- Supplementary materials include complete unedited communications
- Software is open source (GPLv.3) on GitHub
- Funding sources clearly disclosed with grant numbers
- Cost figures and time comparisons are specific and verifiable

**Weaknesses:**
- No author contributions statement
- Potential conflicts of interest not disclosed (authors include FAIMS team members)
- Thematic coding procedure not documented
- Case study selection process not transparent
- No pre-registration (though unusual for this paper type)

**Evidence:**
- E029: GPLv.3 open source licence
- E030: GitHub repository for modules
- E001, E003: Grant numbers disclosed (RT043, LE140100151)
- IA009: Implicit assumption that FAIMS team perspective is objective

**Code/Data Availability (from extraction):**
- Code availability: Yes (GitHub, Google Play)
- Data availability: Yes (digital supplement)
- Licence: GPLv.3

#### Score: **72/100**

**Justification:** Strong transparency in terms of software availability, funding disclosure, and supplementary materials. The complete unedited communications with project directors are a notable strength. However, the lack of conflict of interest disclosure is significant given that authors include both FAIMS developers and users evaluating their own system. Thematic analysis procedure opacity reduces transparency score.

## Cluster 1 Summary

| Signal | Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Comprehensibility | 68 | 0.5 | 34.0 |
| Transparency | 72 | 0.5 | 36.0 |
| **Cluster 1 Total** | — | — | **70.0** |

**Cluster Assessment:** MODERATE-HIGH

The paper demonstrates reasonable foundational clarity. The research is generally comprehensible and well-structured, with good transparency in terms of data and code availability. Key limitations are the undisclosed potential conflicts of interest and the opaque thematic analysis procedure. The supplementary materials with complete communications partially offset these concerns by enabling independent verification.
