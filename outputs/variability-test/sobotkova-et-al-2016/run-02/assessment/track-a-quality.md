# Track A: Quality Gating Assessment

**Paper:** Sobotkova et al. (2016) - Measure Twice, Cut Once
**Run ID:** run-02
**Assessment Date:** 2025-12-04

## Quality State Determination

### Overall Quality State: **MODERATE**

The extraction provides sufficient material for caveated assessment. Methodological paper with good extraction coverage but some informal evidence basis.

---

## Dimension 1: Extraction Quality

**Score:** 7/10 (MODERATE-HIGH)

### Strengths

- Comprehensive coverage of all paper sections
- 35 evidence items, 50 claims, 8 implicit arguments extracted
- 5 research designs, 5 methods, 10 protocols identified
- Clear three-tier RDMAP hierarchy with cross-references

### Weaknesses

- Several claims lack linked evidence (theoretical claims without empirical support)
- Cost and time metrics are self-reported rather than independently verified
- User feedback described as "universal" without systematic collection methodology
- No page numbers available for precise location tracking

### Extraction Completeness

| Array | Count | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Evidence | 35 | Adequate for methodological paper |
| Claims | 50 | Comprehensive coverage |
| Implicit Arguments | 8 | Good identification of assumptions |
| Research Designs | 5 | Complete |
| Methods | 5 | Complete |
| Protocols | 10 | Comprehensive |

## Dimension 2: Metric-Signal Alignment

**Score:** 6/10 (MODERATE)

### Transparency Metrics

- **Code availability:** HIGH - GitHub repository, GPLv3 licence explicitly stated
- **Data availability:** MODERATE - Supplementary materials referenced but no DOI
- **Workflow documentation:** HIGH - Detailed deployment procedures described

### Reproducibility Metrics

- **Method transparency:** MODERATE - General workflow clear but specifics vary by case
- **Protocol specificity:** MODERATE - Some protocols explicit, others implicit
- **Replication guidance:** HIGH - Module customisation process well-documented

### Alignment Issues

- FAIR assessment shows 72.5% score (moderate-high)
- Software reproducibility excellent; deployment process reproducibility moderate
- No systematic data collection protocols for user feedback metrics

---

## Dimension 3: Classification Confidence

**Score:** 8/10 (HIGH)

### Paper Type Confidence

- **Classification:** Methodological paper
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Rationale:** Clear focus on software deployment methodology rather than archaeological findings

### Research Approach Confidence

- **Classification:** Inductive (revealed)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Rationale:** Themes derived from case observations; no pre-specified hypotheses

### HARKing Assessment

- **Detection:** None
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Rationale:** No expressed methodology to contradict; consistently inductive framing

## Quality Gate Decision

### Gate Result: **PASS (MODERATE)**

**Routing:** Full assessment with caveats

### Caveats to Apply

1. **Evidence basis caveat:** Several quantitative claims based on self-reported metrics without independent verification
2. **Sampling caveat:** Three case studies represent convenience sample of early FAIMS adopters; not systematically selected
3. **Feedback methodology caveat:** User experience claims based on informal feedback, not systematic evaluation

### Assessment Pathway

Proceed with full Seven Signals assessment using **methodological paper anchors**:
- Emphasise workflow transparency over experimental reproducibility
- Focus on documentation quality and deployment clarity
- Consider software-specific reproducibility standards
