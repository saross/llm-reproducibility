    "classification": "methodological",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "The paper's primary purpose is to describe and evaluate a methodology (FAIMS mobile platform deployment) rather than to present new empirical findings about the archaeological sites themselves. It uses case studies instrumentally to illustrate software co-development processes, not as primary research outcomes."

      ],
      "justification": "The paper works inductively from specific deployment experiences to general claims about software co-development. Themes are derived from case observations rather than tested against pre-specified hypotheses. Conclusions generalise from particular cases to broader claims about generalised vs bespoke software approaches."
