  "paper_type": "methodological",
  "paper_type_justification": "This paper presents case studies of software deployment (FAIMS mobile platform) rather than investigating archaeological phenomena directly. The primary contribution is methodological guidance about co-development processes, cost-benefit analysis, and lessons learned from deploying generalised field recording software. Claims focus on software effectiveness, deployment practices, and co-development principles rather than archaeological discoveries. The three case studies (Boncuklu, MEMSAP, PAZC) serve as vehicles for demonstrating the platform's capabilities and extracting generalisable lessons about digital recording in archaeology.",

  "primary_classification": {
    "approach": "inductive",
    "confidence": "high",
    "justification": "This is clearly inductive case study research. The paper systematically documents three deployment experiences, identifies recurring themes across cases, and derives generalisable lessons. No a priori hypotheses are tested; instead, the research explores what happened when FAIMS was deployed and what can be learned from those experiences. The three themes (upfront costs/backend payouts, trade-offs/shared lessons, archaeological interpretation) emerge from the case data rather than from theoretical predictions. Workflow is inductive: observe deployments → identify patterns → synthesise lessons → recommend practices. Classification confidence is high because design, methods, and claims consistently indicate exploratory/descriptive research aimed at theory-building from cases."

Generalisability important but appropriately bounded to similar contexts. Reproducibility less critical for case studies (contextual rather than replicable). Robustness somewhat deemphasised - case studies generate hypotheses rather than testing them across conditions."

  "classification_notes": "Methodological paper using inductive case study design. Paper fits 'methodological' paper type and 'inductive' research approach. Authors are FAIMS team members evaluating their own software - positionality noted in extraction (RD005) but not formally disclosed. Classification from queue.yaml specified 'mixed' approach but revealed approach is pure inductive. Three case studies provide systematic evidence for generalisable claims about software co-development practices."
