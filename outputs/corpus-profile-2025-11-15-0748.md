### SCS: Scope Constraint Score

**Corpus mean:** 3.90
**Corpus median:** 0.50
**Standard deviation:** 5.76
**Range:** 0 - 17

**Papers with no limitations extracted:** 5/10 (50%)

**Distribution:** Extremely right-skewed. Most papers have few/no limitations, some have many.

**Example papers:**

- **No limitations:** Environmental conditions in the SE Balkans since t... (2013, score=0)
- **Moderate limitations:** Validating predictions of burial mounds with field... (2024, score=1)
- **Many limitations:** Measure Twice, Cut Once: Cooperative Deployment of... (2016, score=17)

⚠️ **Note:** High SCS doesn't necessarily mean better research. Review limitation quality, not just quantity.

## Corpus-Level Observations

### Homogeneity vs Heterogeneity

**Overall homogeneity:** Low (heterogeneous corpus). Papers vary widely across metrics. Diverse corpus or wide quality range.

**Low-variance metrics (CV < 0.1):** TCI
- These metrics show little variation across corpus. May not be discriminating in this sample.

**High-variance metrics (CV > 1.0):** ESD, SCS
- These metrics show substantial variation across corpus. Good discriminating power.

## Interpretation Notes

### Limitations of This Corpus Profile

- **Small sample (n=10)**: Statistics are unstable. Percentiles may shift dramatically with additional papers.
- **No ground truth**: Metrics not validated against external quality assessments. High scores may reflect extraction quality, not research quality.
- **Corpus-specific patterns**: Observations may not generalise to other domains, genres, or time periods.
- **Extraction dependency**: All metrics depend on extraction quality and granularity decisions.

### Using This Profile

This profile should be used to:

1. **Understand corpus characteristics** before interpreting individual paper scores
2. **Identify metrics with good discriminating power** (high variance) vs poor power (low variance)
3. **Calibrate expectations** for what constitutes "typical" vs "exceptional" scores
4. **Compare corpora** (if multiple corpus profiles generated)
5. **Inform metric refinement** (identify problematic metrics needing adjustment)

Do NOT use this profile to:

- Make definitive claims about research quality
- Compare papers from different corpora without controlling for corpus characteristics
- Treat corpus means as universal quality thresholds
