The value of this approach lies in the unanticipated success of a minimally resourced digitisation effort, as well as the resulting dataset's value for archaeological research and cultural heritage management. Digitisation was undertaken as a secondary activity on a landscape archaeology project focusing on pedestrian feature survey. Undergraduates in the associated field school digitised data from maps using a system repurposed from other project activities.",
