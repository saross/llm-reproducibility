## Paper Overview

### Research Context

Crowdsourced georeferencing of historical maps using novice volunteers

**Study Period:** 2017-2018

**Location:** Yambol region, southeast Bulgaria (20,000 sq km)

### Key Research Designs

- **RD001:** Case study approach to demonstrate crowdsourced map digitization as minimally resourced auxiliary activity during archae...
- **RD002:** Comparative evaluation framework for assessing digitization approaches (desktop GIS by experts, desktop GIS by volunteer...
- **RD003:** Usability-focused system design prioritizing 'useful' tools combining utility and usability for novice volunteers...
- **RD004:** Efficiency evaluation design using staff time as primary metric for comparing digitization approaches...


### Core Methods (8 total)

- **M001** [explicit]: Crowdsourcing approach using undergraduate field school participants as novice volunteers for map di...
- **M002** [explicit]: Mobile application customization approach using FAIMS Mobile platform to create streamlined GIS for ...
- **M003** [explicit]: Offline-first data collection method tolerating degraded network connectivity in rural field conditi...
- **M004** [explicit]: Random sampling quality assurance method for accuracy checking of volunteer digitization...
- **M005** [explicit]: Time-on-task measurement method tracking staff and volunteer hours for efficiency evaluation...


### Key Findings (Sample Claims)

- **C001:** The crowdsourcing approach is most efficient for digitisation projects of 10,000-60,000 features
- **C002:** The approach may offer advantages for datasets as small as a few hundred records
- **C003:** Systems designed for field data collection, running on mobile devices, can be profitably customised to serve as participatory geospatial data systems accessible to novice volunteers
- **C004:** The crowdsourcing approach produced a large, accurate, analysis-ready dataset with minimal training and supervision
- **C005:** The approach complements Machine Learning by requiring less technical expertise, time, and resourcing to undertake

## Extraction Notes

### Pass Completion

✓ Pass 1: Claims & Evidence (Liberal extraction)
✓ Pass 2: Claims & Evidence (Rationalization)
✓ Pass 3: RDMAP Explicit extraction
✓ Pass 4: RDMAP Implicit scan
✓ Pass 5: RDMAP Rationalization
✓ Pass 6: Validation & reporting

### Key Observations

1. **Well-documented methods paper:** Most procedures explicitly described in Section 2 (Approach)
2. **Quantitative evaluation:** Extensive time-on-task and error rate data
3. **Comparative framework:** Systematic comparison of digitization approaches
4. **Minimal implicit RDMAP:** Only 5 implicit items (2 methods, 3 protocols) due to thorough explicit documentation

### Extraction Strategy

- Conservative rationalization in Pass 2 (6.5% reduction)
- Section-by-section approach for liberal passes (1 & 3)
- Minimal RDMAP consolidation needed (0% reduction in Pass 5)
- Relationship verification and bidirectional mapping in Pass 5
