The need for high-touch training and support by project staff during fieldwork, combined with a dislike for the activity on the part of students, prevented us from scaling up the use of desktop GIS for volunteer digitisation further, despite attempting to do so. Most volunteers did not persevere with the activity long enough to repay their initial training time. Indeed, one persistent student accounted for almost all the digitised features; without his perseverance, the digitisation effort would have failed entirely."

Using this input, and after additional preprocessing and filtering, an ML expert spent seven days testing and fine tuning the model. The output was impressive: some 300,000 km of roads were digitised. This example, which appears to have required a minimum of about 1,300 h of preparation time alone, suggests that ML approaches are worthwhile for large-scale projects that benefit from the consistent symbology and style (as found in British and Ottoman imperial maps)."
