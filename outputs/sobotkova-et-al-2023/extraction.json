Spatial data omissions resulted from a failure of the software to populate the latitude and longitude fields from the application's SpatiaLite geodatabase due to users moving through the forms too quickly (see 'Application performance' above). Before the 2018 season, we added validation addressing this problem, resulting in only 13 spatial errors and one attribute omission (0.52%).
