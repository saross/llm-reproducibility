        "A minimum threshold for automation can be extrapolated from our 2017-18 fieldwork and the Urban Occupations Project. We spent 44 staff hours customising and deploying a streamlined geospatial system in FAIMS Mobile, 184 participant-hours digitising features, seven staff-hours directly supporting that digitisation, and six staff hours checking for errors. These 241 h produced a dataset of 10,827 features, a rate of 44.9 features/person-hour. At that rate, the 1,300 h it took to deploy the ML approach taken by Can, Gerrits, and Kabadayi would yield about 58,400 records"
