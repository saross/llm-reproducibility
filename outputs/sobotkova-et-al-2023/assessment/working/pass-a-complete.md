Below 10,000 records, approaches using desktop GIS should be considered. Under the most conservative scenario that considers all invested time, the use of our system pays off between about 3,500 – 4,500 features versus direct digitisation by staff using desktop GIS, and about 7,500 – 10,000 features versus support for volunteers using desktop GIS. Projects where staff time is at a premium, or that operate alongside fieldwork where staff have many competing demands, may find it valuable for smaller datasets (even those below 1,000 records). Above 60,000 records, ML approaches should be contemplated"

Spatial data omissions resulted from a failure of the software to populate the latitude and longitude fields from the application's SpatiaLite geodatabase due to users moving through the forms too quickly [...] Before the 2018 season, we added validation addressing this problem, resulting in only 13 spatial errors and one attribute omission (0.52%).

- **Justification text:** "Digitisation undertaken as secondary activity, using time otherwise lost to weather and downtime"
- **Page:** 1, Introduction + Section 3.2 (lines 31, 305)
- **Verbatim quote:** "Digitisation was undertaken as a secondary activity on a landscape archaeology project" and "yielded large and valuable datasets utilising time that might otherwise have been lost (e.g., to inclement weather)"
- **Type:** opportunistic_design
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Accurate synthesis
- **Errors:** None

### RD004: "Platform selection framework prioritizing offline operation and usability"

**Verification:**
- **Justification text:** "Decision based on five factors: offline operation, functional requirements, HCI transferability, platform reuse, and volunteer UI preferences"
- **Page:** 4, Section 2.3 (lines 239-246)
- **Verbatim quote:** "The decision to use mobile software, and FAIMS Mobile in particular, was based on several factors. First, FAIMS Mobile worked offline. [...] Second, this system met the functional requirements [...] Third, it allowed us to test the idea that usability approaches [...] Fourth, we were already using FAIMS Mobile [...] Fifth, student volunteers are accustomed to, and even prefer, 'slippy-map', touch-screen interfaces"
- **Type:** platform_selection_framework
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Accurate synthesis of decision framework
- **Errors:** None

### RD-IMP-001: "Comparative positioning relative to desktop GIS and machine learning approaches" (IMPLICIT)

**Verification:**
- **Justification:** (null - needs extraction)
- **Design evidence:** Section 4.1 (lines 393-440) systematically compares crowdsourcing vs desktop GIS (4.1.1) and vs ML (4.1.2), Section 4.2 discusses complementarity
- **Implicit nature:** Comparative benchmarking framework is executed (payoff thresholds, velocity comparisons, threshold analysis) but not explicitly framed as a research design upfront
- **Type:** comparative_benchmarking
- **Status:** ⚠️ DATA QUALITY ISSUE - Justification field is null (should contain synthesis explaining implicit design)
- **Accuracy:** Content is accurate, but missing justification_text is a minor data quality issue
- **Penalty:** −0.5 points (incomplete data, though design identification is correct)

---

**RESEARCH_DESIGNS SECTION COMPLETE**

**Final research designs tally:**
- **Total research designs:** 5 (including 1 implicit)
- **Research designs verified:** 5/5 (100% identification accuracy)
- **Content errors:** 0
- **Data quality issues:** 1 (RD-IMP-001 missing justification text)
- **Total penalty points:** −0.5

**Research Designs accuracy:** 99% (4.5/5 correct after penalty)

| **Total** | **6** | | | **−9.0** |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Evidence extraction exemplary (100%)** - All 58 items verified correct
2. **RDMAP extraction excellent (100%, 99%)** - Methods 7/7, Protocols 10/10, Designs 4.5/5
3. **Claims have systematic issues (88.4%)** - All errors concentrated in claims
4. **No hallucinations or confabulations detected** - All errors are categorization/attribution/context issues
5. **Pattern confirmed across full dataset** - Medium assessment findings hold for complete extraction

**Detailed Errors:**

1. **C004** (−3): Context error + miscategorization
2. **C018** (−3): Misattribution (literature claim)
3. **C032** (−2): Context error (mixed content)
4. **C064** (−0.5): Page number missing
5. **RD-IMP-001** (−0.5): Missing justification text (data quality)

**Overall Accuracy Score: 94.1% (Grade A-)**
