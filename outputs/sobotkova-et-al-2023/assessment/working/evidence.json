These 241 h produced a dataset of 10,827 features, a rate of 44.9 features/person-hour. At that rate, the 1,300 h it took to deploy the ML approach taken by Can, Gerrits, and Kabadayi would yield about 58,400 records, assuming that all features discovered by the ML model take zero additional personnel time, that our target symbols are no more difficult to extract that road segments, and discounting time the Urban Occupations Project spent on quality assurance, which they did not report.",
