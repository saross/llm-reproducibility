### C064: "Crowdsourcing approach is most suitable for datasets of 10,000-60,000 features; below 10,000 desktop GIS should be considered (payoff threshold at 4,500 for expert staff, 10,000 for supervised volunteers, or as low as 1,000 when staff time is at premium); above 60,000 ML approaches should be contemplated"

**Verification:**

- **Verbatim quote:** "To summarise in round numbers, a crowdsourcing approach like ours is most suitable for datasets numbering perhaps 10,000 – 60,000 records, assuming similar feature characteristics and data collection requirements (see Table 5). Below 10,000 records, approaches using desktop GIS should be considered. Under the most conservative scenario that considers all invested time, the use of our system pays off between about 3,500 – 4,500 features versus direct digitisation by staff using desktop GIS, and about 7,500 – 10,000 features versus support for volunteers using desktop GIS. Projects where staff time is at a premium, or that operate alongside fieldwork where staff have many competing demands, may find it valuable for smaller datasets (even those below 1,000 records). Above 60,000 records, ML approaches should be contemplated"

### C066: "A combination of ML and crowdsourcing approaches might serve even large-scale projects, as crowdsourcing can produce training datasets and error-checking datasets for ML"

**Verification:**
- **Page:** 10, Section 4.2 (line 442)
- **Verbatim quote:** "Finally, since training a model requires a manually produced dataset and a degree of manual error-checking, a combination of ML and crowdsourcing approaches might serve even large-scale projects. A dataset big enough to justify ML will likely need a training dataset big enough to warrant crowdsourcing, especially if the features or background are variable. Once the crowdsourcing platform has been built, moreover, it can be used to produce additional datasets for error-checking to confirm the accuracy of the ML results."
