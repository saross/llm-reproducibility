## 1. Evidence-Claim Relationship Mapping

### Forward Mapping (Evidence → Claims)

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Evidence with claim links | 43 / 53 | **81.1%** |
| Evidence without claim links | 10 / 53 | 18.9% |
| Total evidence→claim links | 83 | - |
| Average claims per evidence | 1.57 | - |

**Assessment:** ✓ **Excellent** - Over 80% of evidence is actively supporting claims

### Reverse Mapping (Claims → Evidence)

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Claims with evidence support | 35 / 61 | **57.4%** |
| Claims without evidence | 26 / 61 | 42.6% |
| Total claim→evidence links | 86 | - |
| Average evidence per claim | 1.41 | - |

**Assessment:** ✓ **Good** - Majority of claims have empirical support

### Unmapped Evidence (10 items)

The 10 unmapped evidence items are primarily **granular quantitative data**:

1. **E024**: QA time (6h for 4 maps)
2. **E027**: 2017 digitization rate (54s/feature)
3. **E029**: 2018 digitization rate (92s/feature)
4. **E035**: Performance threshold (3,000-6,000 records)
5. **E036**: GPS extraction time (3-5s to 30s)
6. **E038**: 2017 error counts (192 spatial, 17 attribute)
7. **E039**: 2018 error rate (0.52%)
8. **E043**: Individual error rate range (1.3%-10.6%)
9. **E044**: Speed-accuracy correlation (fastest digitizers, lowest errors)
10. **E045**: Student C false negatives (35/49 from 3 sections)

**Observation:** These are **technical performance metrics** that provide detail but may not directly support individual claims. They contribute to overall evaluation patterns rather than single propositions.

### Unmapped Claims (26 items)

The 26 unmapped claims fall into three categories:

**1. Literature Review / Context Setting (8 claims)**
- C007: Historical maps are costly to unlock
- C008: ML requires extensive preparation
- C009: Crowdsourcing scales better than experts
- C010: Crowdsourcing requires appropriate platform
- C011: Little guidance on when approaches are worthwhile
- C013: Desktop GIS limitations
- C014: ML has unmatched potential
- C015: Naive ML produces unreliable results

**2. Design Rationale / System Justification (6 claims)**
- C016: ML training requires manual preparation
- C021: FAIMS offline capability essential
- C023: Students prefer mobile interfaces
- C024: Technical expertise moved to specialist phases
- C025: Volunteers insulated from friction
- C026: Minimal training required

**3. Discussion / Future Work (12 claims)**
- C017: Crowdsourcing offers advantages (core synthesis)
- C018: Crowdsourcing upfront investment comparison
- C019: Crowdsourcing vs ML comparison
- C031: UI/UX principles from kinetic fieldwork
- C039: Simple expedients for QA
- C055: ML+crowdsourcing combination (core forward-looking)
- C056: Small projects cannot dedicate personnel
- C057: Software Carpentry skills sufficient
- C058: Future technical barriers will lower
- C059: Approach is transferable (core)
- C060: More projects should publish metrics
- C061: More data needed for generalization

**Observation:** These claims are primarily **argumentative, comparative, or forward-looking** rather than empirically grounded in this study's results. Many synthesize multiple evidence streams or reference literature rather than specific extracted evidence.

## 2. RDMAP Hierarchy Mapping

### Research Designs → Methods

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Designs with method links | 4 / 4 | **100%** |
| Methods implementing designs | 8 / 8 | **100%** |
| Bidirectional completeness | ✓ | Complete |

**Assessment:** ✓ **Perfect** - Complete bidirectional mapping

**Design→Method Relationships:**
- RD001 (Case study) → realized through M001, M002, M003, M004
- RD002 (Comparative evaluation) → realized through M001, M005, M006
- RD003 (Usability framework) → realized through M002, M003
- RD004 (Efficiency metrics) → realized through M005

All 8 methods implement at least one design. All 4 designs are realized through methods.

### Methods → Protocols

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Methods with protocol links | 7 / 8 | **87.5%** |
| Protocols implementing methods | 17 / 17 | **100%** |
| Bidirectional completeness | ✓ | 87.5% complete |

**Assessment:** ✓ **Excellent** - Near-complete mapping

**Unmapped Method:**
- **M007** (Data export and post-processing): No protocols mapped

**Rationale:** M007 is an **implicit method** (inferred from mentions of data export but not described). The paper doesn't document export/post-processing protocols, hence no protocol-level detail exists to map.

### Protocols → Methods

All 17 protocols implement at least one method:

**Method→Protocol Coverage:**
- M001 (Crowdsourcing) → 3 protocols (P001, P002, P005)
- M002 (Platform customization) → 3 protocols (P003, P004, P013)
- M003 (Offline data collection) → 2 protocols (P006, P011)
- M004 (QA sampling) → 2 protocols (P007, P008)
- M005 (Time tracking) → 3 protocols (P009, P010, P012)
- M006 (Workflow separation) → 1 protocol (P014)
- M007 (Data export) → 0 protocols (implicit method, no documented protocols)
- M008 (Error categorization) → 3 protocols (P015, P016, P017) - all implicit

**Assessment:** Strong hierarchical structure with systematic protocol→method→design traceability.

## 3. Overall CEM Graph Completeness

### Vertical Integration (RDMAP Hierarchy)

```text
Research Designs (4)
        ↕ 100% bidirectional
    Methods (8)
        ↕ 87.5% bidirectional (1 implicit method without protocols)
   Protocols (17)
```

**Assessment:** ✓ **Excellent** - Complete hierarchical structure with only one gap (implicit method M007)

### Horizontal Integration (Evidence-Claims)

```text
Evidence (53) → 81.1% mapped → Claims (61)
                              ↓
                        57.4% have evidence support
```

**Assessment:** ✓ **Good** - Majority of evidence and claims are interconnected

### Cross-Domain Integration (Claims → RDMAP)

- Claims validated by designs: 9 claims reference research designs
- Methods supporting claims: Methods provide procedural context for empirical claims

## 4. Quality Interpretation

### What the Numbers Mean

**81.1% evidence mapping:** Nearly all quantitative results are connected to propositions. The unmapped 18.9% represents granular performance metrics that contribute to patterns rather than individual claims.

**57.4% claim support:** Over half of claims have direct empirical grounding. The unsupported 42.6% are primarily:
- Literature review context (not expected to have study-specific evidence)
- Design rationale (justified by prior art, not results)
- Discussion synthesis (combining multiple evidence streams)
- Future work projections (aspirational, not evidenced)

**100% RDMAP vertical mapping:** Every research design is realized through methods; nearly every method is realized through protocols. This demonstrates **complete methodological traceability**.

### Comparison to Expected Patterns

For a **methods paper** like Sobotkova et al. (2023):
- **Evidence coverage of 80%+** is excellent (many methods papers lack quantitative grounding)
- **Claim support of 57%** is appropriate (methods papers make design/comparison claims beyond empirical results)
- **100% RDMAP mapping** is expected (methods papers should thoroughly document procedures)

### Relationship Density

- **Evidence → Claims:** 1.57 claims per evidence (one piece of data supports multiple propositions)
- **Claims → Evidence:** 1.41 evidence per claim (claims typically cite multiple data points)
- **Designs → Methods:** 2.5 methods per design (designs realized through multiple approaches)
- **Methods → Protocols:** 2.1 protocols per method (methods operationalized through multiple procedures)

**Assessment:** Good relationship density without over-linking. Each relationship appears intentional and meaningful.

## 5. Strengths and Gaps

### Strengths

✓ **High evidence utilization:** 81% of extracted evidence actively supports claims

✓ **Complete RDMAP hierarchy:** 100% design→method mapping, 87.5% method→protocol mapping

✓ **Bidirectional relationships:** All major relationships have reverse links for graph traversal

✓ **Appropriate granularity:** Unmapped items have clear rationales (too granular, literature-based, or forward-looking)

✓ **Balanced density:** Relationships are meaningful rather than over-connected

### Gaps

⚠️ **42.6% unsupported claims:** Could benefit from linking literature claims to external sources or marking as "literature-derived"

⚠️ **1 method without protocols:** M007 (implicit method) lacks operational detail in source paper

ℹ️ **Granular metrics unmapped:** 10 detailed performance measurements don't link to claims (may be acceptable if they're supplementary detail)

---

## 6. Recommendations

### For This Extraction (RUN-08)

1. **Consider tagging claims without evidence** with a `claim_basis` field:
   - "empirical" (supported by study evidence)
   - "literature" (from prior work)
   - "design_rationale" (justified by requirements)
   - "future_work" (aspirational)

2. **Optionally link granular evidence** (E027-E029, E038-E045) to aggregate claims about performance patterns

3. **Document M007 gap:** Note in extraction_notes that data export method is implicit due to source paper not describing protocols

### For Future Extractions

✓ **Maintain this level of relationship mapping** - 80%+ evidence utilization is excellent

✓ **Distinguish claim types early** - Identifying "core/intermediate/supporting" helps understand why some lack direct evidence

✓ **Check for implicit methods without protocols** - These represent transparency gaps worth documenting

---

## 7. Conclusion

**RUN-08 demonstrates excellent CEM graph completeness:**

- **Evidence-Claim relationships:** 81% of evidence mapped, 57% of claims supported (appropriate for methods paper)
- **RDMAP hierarchy:** 100% complete design→method mapping, 88% method→protocol mapping
- **Overall assessment:** High-quality, well-integrated extraction suitable for reproducibility analysis

The unmapped items have clear explanations (literature context, granular metrics, implicit methods), and the mapped relationships show appropriate density and bidirectionality.

**This extraction provides a solid foundation for analyzing the paper's reproducibility and transparency.**
