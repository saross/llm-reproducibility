## Consolidation Strategy

This palaeoenvironmental reconstruction paper has high methodological detail with sequential analytical workflows. Consolidation will focus on:

1. **Sequential workflow steps** - Merge connected procedural steps into compound protocols
2. **Redundant methodological descriptions** - Consolidate repeated chronology and analysis statements
3. **Related citation clusters** - Merge citations discussing same themes
4. **Compound proxy observations** - Integrate multi-proxy observations of same stratigraphic phenomena

**Principle:** Conservative rationalization preserving distinct:
- Temporal phases (Cold steppe, Semidesert, Forest-steppe, Oak woods, Deforestation)
- Proxy types (pollen, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, NPPs)
- Spatial contexts (quarry section vs canal core)
- Technical distinctions (microscopic vs macroscopic charcoal, different magnetic analyses)

- **Keep ID:** C053
- **New Content:** "Detrended Correspondence Analysis and cluster analysis in PC-Ord with taxonomic standardisation to remove methodological artefacts, combined with indicator species analysis (p=0.001 with Monte Carlo testing) and temporal plotting, provides objective statistical basis for comparing palaeovegetational patterns and identifying characteristic taxa across multiple sites while assessing synchronous vs. asynchronous vegetation changes across region"

## Consolidation Summary

| Category | Consolidations | Items Reduced |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Chronology Redundancy | 5 | 11 → 5 (−6) |
| Analytical Workflows | 4 | 18 → 4 (−14) |
| Pollen Analysis | 2 | 5 → 2 (−3) |
| Citations | 3 | 8 → 3 (−5) |
| Site Context | 2 | 5 → 2 (−3) |
| Additional | 4 | 8 → 4 (−4) |
| **TOTAL** | **20** | **55 → 20 (−35)** |

**Projected Final Count:** 213 − 35 = **178 items**
**Reduction Percentage:** 35/213 = **16.4%**
**Target Achievement:** ✓ Within 10-20% target range

---

## Rationale for Conservative Approach

This 16.4% reduction is appropriate because:

1. **Diverse proxy types preserved:** Pollen, charcoal (micro and macro), magnetic susceptibility, NPPs - each provides independent information
2. **Temporal phases distinct:** Five vegetation phases (Cold steppe, Semidesert, Forest-steppe, Oak woods, Deforestation) require separate evidence/claims
3. **Two cores:** Quarry section vs canal core observations kept separate where distinct
4. **Methodological vs results distinction:** Consolidation focused on sequential workflows within methods, not on distinct results
5. **Regional comparisons preserved:** Citations to other sites (Tenaghi Philippon, Ezero, Black Sea cores, Lake Prespa) maintained as distinct evidence

---

## Items Excluded from Consolidation

**NOT consolidated despite superficial similarity:**

- **Vegetation phase evidence:** E070-E084 describe distinct stratigraphic zones with different assemblages
- **Temporal observations:** Distinct chronological claims for each vegetation phase (C075-C089)
- **Research questions:** E001-E003 are three distinct research questions, not redundant
- **Regional correlation claims:** C095-C107 compare to different sites/contexts
- **Magnetic susceptibility results:** E081 (VFTB analysis) vs E082 (magnetic zones) are distinct findings, not procedural steps

---
