    "fitness_for_use": "Suitable for evidence-claims transparency assessment (excellent quality). Methods and protocols support replicability evaluation (excellent quality). Research design assessment SEVERELY COMPROMISED by missing design-method mappings - requires urgent correction before use for design quality evaluation. With Priority 1 correction (populating design-method mappings), overall extraction would achieve Grade A and full production-readiness."

  "comparison_to_sobotkova_assessment": {
    "similarities": [
      "Both show perfect RDMAP item accuracy (methods, protocols, designs: 100%)",
      "Both show near-perfect evidence accuracy (Connor: 99%, Sobotkova: 100%)",
      "Both show lower claims accuracy (Connor: 94.7%, Sobotkova: 88.4%)",
      "Both demonstrate sophisticated consolidation judgment",

    "differences": [
      "Connor has CRITICAL design-method mapping gap (28.6%), Sobotkova excellent (100%)",
      "Connor fewer total errors (5 vs 6), but includes systematic mapping failure",
      "Connor overall mapping score much lower (74.5% vs 99.1%) due to RDMAP hierarchy gap",
      "Sobotkova errors concentrated in claims accuracy; Connor errors span accuracy + mapping",
      "Connor has duplicate content issue (C063); Sobotkova has context/attribution issues",
      "Connor total items larger (247 vs 153), mappings comparable (145 vs 110)"
    ],
    "overall_comparison": "Connor extraction shows excellent operational work (methods, protocols, evidence) comparable to Sobotkova, but critical strategic gap (design-method mappings) drops overall grade from A to B+. With design-method mappings populated, Connor would match or exceed Sobotkova quality."
