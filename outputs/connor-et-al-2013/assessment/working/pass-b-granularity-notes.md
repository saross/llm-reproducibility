# Pass B: Granularity Assessment - Connor et al. 2013

## Assessment Overview

Evaluating whether items are appropriately scoped - neither over-split (too atomic) nor under-split (too aggregated).

**Total Items:** 247

## Evidence Granularity (99 items)

### Overall: EXCELLENT (100%)

**Issues Identified:** 0

### Analysis

   - Linear extrapolation + chronological framework establishment
   - **Rationale:** Complete chronological modelling workflow
   - **Assessment:** Appropriate - maintains methodological coherence

4. **E063** - Magnetic mineralogy consolidation
   - Note: Has verbatim quote error (flagged in Pass A) but consolidation principle sound
   - Authigenic/detrital ferrimagnetic + paramagnetic material
   - **Assessment:** Appropriate scope, needs quote correction

5. **E067** - Cluster analysis and visualisation
   - Cluster analysis + palaeovegetation phase grouping + Psimpoll visualisation
   - **Rationale:** Complete analytical workflow from analysis to presentation
   - **Assessment:** Appropriate - maintains analysis-to-output chain

6. **E068** - DCA statistical results
   - Variance explanation (46% axis 1, 20% axis 2) + agreement with cluster analysis
   - **Rationale:** Integrated statistical validation finding
   - **Assessment:** Appropriate - maintains statistical coherence

7. **E044** - Data presentation (noted as consolidated)
   - Rationalisation note mentions "Consolidated from C050, E044 in Pass 2"
   - Results plotted using Psimpoll
   - **Assessment:** Scope appropriate

#### Appropriate Atomic Items
Items that might appear candidates for consolidation but correctly remain separate:

- **E001-E005:** Separate vegetation phases
  - Each represents distinct palaeoenvironmental period with specific dates
  - Correctly kept separate to support independent claims about each phase

- **E053, E088:** Both mention "Thirteen AMS radiocarbon dates"
  - E053 (p.9): Initial mention of obtaining dates
  - E088 (p.13): Results discussion context
  - **Assessment:** Appropriate - different contexts (methods vs results)

- **E071-E073:** Cold steppe phase characteristics
  - E071: Pollen percentages (Artemisia, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae)
  - E072: Arboreal pollen (Pinus, Quercus, Betula)
  - E073: Pediastrum abundance
  - **Assessment:** Appropriate - different proxy types merit separate items

- **E079-E081:** Oak woods phase quantification
  - E079: Quercus percentages (up to 52%)
  - E080: Quercus concentration increase (3× previous)
  - E081: Ulmus and Corylus concentration doubling
  - **Assessment:** Appropriate - different taxa and measurement types

#### No Over-splitting Detected
- No evidence items are excessively atomic
- All items represent meaningful units of evidence
- Consolidation notes demonstrate thoughtful aggregation where appropriate

#### No Under-splitting Issues
- Complex multi-component evidence appropriately consolidated
- No items attempt to pack unrelated findings together

### Granularity Score: 100%

## Claims Granularity (76 items)

### Overall: EXCELLENT (98.7%)

**Issues Identified:** 1 under-split

#### Issue: C075 + C076 Potential Under-split
- **C075:** "Cold steppe phase dominated by Artemisia (24-37%) and Poaceae (8-25%), with Chenopodiaceae, Ranunculus-type and Polygonum aviculare-type well represented"
- **C076:** "Pinus most abundant arboreal pollen type (3-26%) in cold steppe phase, but Quercus, Betula, Juniperus and Celtis also occur throughout"
- **Verbatim (p.11):** Both from same paragraph describing cold steppe phase pollen assemblage
- **Assessment:** APPROPRIATE SPLIT
  - C075: Herbaceous taxa (steppe indicators)
  - C076: Arboreal taxa (refugial populations)
  - **Rationale:** Distinct ecological groups with different interpretive significance
  - **Conclusion:** NOT an error - functionally appropriate separation

#### Actually Appropriate Claim Separations
After detailed review, all claims show appropriate granularity:

1. **Vegetation transition claims (C001)** - Summarises entire sequence appropriately
2. **Phase-specific claims (C075-C089)** - Each focuses on distinct palaeoecological observation
3. **Chronological boundary claims (C095, C097)** - Separate claims for distinct boundaries
4. **Methodological claims (C039, C042, C053, C061-C064)** - Appropriately scoped to distinct methods

#### Consolidation Assessment
Notable appropriate consolidations:
- Claims about complex vegetation changes consolidated into phase summaries
- Magnetic susceptibility findings appropriately consolidated (C067-C070)
- Statistical analysis results appropriately scoped (C072-C074)

#### Potential Over-split Candidates (All Justified)
Examined pairs for potential over-splitting, all justified:
- C004 + C005 (forest expansion timing vs. moisture balance): Different processes
- C078 + C079 (semidesert characteristics vs. arboreal resurgence): Sequential phases
- C083 (oak woods onset) + C084 (oak woods characteristics): Different aspects
- C086 + C087 + C088 + C089 (deforestation sequence): Temporal progression merits separation

## Pass B Overall Grade: A (99.6%)

### Key Findings

1. **No over-splitting detected:** Strong editorial restraint throughout
2. **Excellent consolidation judgment:** 7 documented evidence consolidations show thoughtful aggregation
3. **RDMAP granularity perfect:** Methods, protocols, and designs appropriately scoped at all levels
4. **Evidence granularity exemplary:** 100% with sophisticated consolidation decisions
5. **Claims nearly perfect:** 98.7% with only duplicate issue (C063)

### Consolidation Patterns
- **Complex methods consolidated:** Charcoal, magnetic, chronological methods appropriately integrated
- **Sequential steps appropriately separated:** Laboratory protocols maintain step-by-step clarity
- **Statistical results consolidated:** Variance explanations and agreement assessments integrated
- **Ecological groupings preserved:** Herbaceous vs. arboreal taxa appropriately separated

### Functional Appropriateness
- Granularity supports **transparency:** Methods and protocols sufficiently detailed for evaluation
- Granularity supports **replicability:** Protocol parameters documented at actionable level
- Granularity supports **credibility assessment:** Evidence units appropriately sized for validation
- Granularity maintains **usability:** Not over-atomised - remains navigable and interpretable

### Overall Assessment
Extraction demonstrates excellent editorial judgment in balancing atomic principle with functional usefulness. Consolidation decisions are well-documented and appropriate. Only one inconsistency (C063 duplicate) detracts from otherwise perfect granularity.
