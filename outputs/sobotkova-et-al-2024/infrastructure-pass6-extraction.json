        "Code availability statement is unusually comprehensive with 3 distinct GitHub repositories for different workflow stages",
        "No data availability statement despite TRAP survey dataset being foundational to analysis - data access unclear",
        "No ORCIDs despite 2024 publication date - reflects low HASS adoption baseline (17-24%)",
        "No author contributions or conflicts statement - standard omission in Journal of Documentation",
        "Archaeological permits implied by institutional collaborations (Kazanlak Museum, Sofia University) but not explicitly documented",
        "Paper focuses on methodological transparency (including failure analysis) but lacks reproducibility infrastructure (archival DOIs, environment specs, licencing)",
        "PID connectivity score 1/6 (minimal) - only paper DOI present",
        "Software documentation question emerges: paper describes 3 repositories with different purposes but no systematic assessment of repository documentation quality, README completeness, or usage instructions"
