# Extraction Rate Comparison: Spot Check

## Quick Comparison Table

| Paper | Pages | Total Items | Items/Page | Evidence | Claims | E+C | E+C/Page |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Sobotkova 2024** (burial mounds ML) | 23 | 100 | 4.3 | 38 | 30 | 68 | **2.96** |
| **Sobotkova 2021** (mobile GIS) | 25 | 175 | 7.0 | 66 | 73 | 139 | **5.56** |
| **Eftimoski 2017** (burial mounds analysis) | 10 | 153 | 15.3 | 32 | 97 | 129 | **12.9** |

## Initial Observation

**Evidence + Claims density for Sobotkova 2024 (2.96/page) is significantly lower than comparators:**
- 47% lower than Sobotkova 2021 (5.56/page)
- 77% lower than Eftimoski 2017 (12.9/page)

This warrants investigation to determine if it's justified by paper structure or represents under-extraction.

## Paper Nature Comparison

### Sobotkova 2024 (This extraction)
- **Type:** Negative results / ML failure documentation
- **Content:** Describes TWO failed model runs with quantitative metrics
- **Structure:** Substantial literature review section (~30% of paper)
- **Results:** Limited positive findings (mostly failure metrics)

### Sobotkova 2021 (Comparison 1)
- **Type:** System implementation / Field deployment
- **Content:** Describes successful mobile GIS deployment with extensive workflows
- **Structure:** Heavy on protocols and procedures
- **Results:** Multiple positive outcomes, efficiency gains, system performance

### Eftimoski 2017 (Comparison 2)
- **Type:** Statistical modelling / Predictive analysis
- **Content:** Ordered logit regression, multiple hypotheses tested
- **Structure:** Dense with statistical claims and interpretations
- **Results:** Multiple significant findings, coefficients, model comparisons

## Hypothesis: Lower Rate May Be Justified

**Potential justifications for lower extraction rate:**

1. **Negative results nature:** Fewer positive findings = fewer claims to extract
2. **Literature review heavy:** ~2,500 words on ML literature (automated approaches section)
3. **Two model runs only:** Limited scope compared to multi-hypothesis papers
4. **Failure documentation:** Much of paper is "what didn't work" rather than "what we found"

## Spot-Check Needed

Need to quickly scan Sobotkova 2024 sections to check for:
1. **Results section:** Are we missing quantitative findings?
2. **Discussion section:** Are we missing interpretive claims?
3. **Methods section:** Are we missing procedural details?
