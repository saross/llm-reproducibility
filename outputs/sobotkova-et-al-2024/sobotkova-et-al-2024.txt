Shkorpil and Shkorpil, 1989, p. 20). Such mounds were built from the Early Bronze Age

destructionsresultfromformalrescueexcavationinanticipationofhousingorinfrastructure
construction, establishment of quarries, or similar development. In 2008, the last year for
which data is available, burial mounds comprised nearly a quarter (57 of 257) of all

Automatedapproachestoremotelysenseddata
Mapping cultural heritage at the scale of a country is a costly task whether it involves
walking the landscape, digitising features from legacy sources like historical maps, or
manually inspectingaerial or satellite images(Brophy andCowley, 2005; Contreras, 2010;
Crawford,1929;DeLaetetal.,2007;DeLaetandLambers,2009).Manualinterpretationof
remotely sensed imagery is not only tedious and time-consuming, but has limitations
imposed by human bias and error (Bowen et al., 2017). Today, however, more and more
remotely sensed datasets are becoming available, requiring scalable and reproducible
approachestotheiranalysis.Manualinspectionisnotwithoutmerit,andexpertsupervision
isessentialto–ormayevenoutperform–automation(Bennettetal.,2014;Casinietal.,2023;
Quintus et al., 2017). Human observers, however, cannot manage the growing volume of
remotelysenseddata,orharnessallthedatacontainedinmodern,global,high-resolution,
multi- or hyperspectral imagery. Expertise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
computationalskills,anddatamanagement,aswellasdomainexpertise,areallneededfor
manualdigitisation,ashortageofwhichhamperscrowdsourcingandcitizenscienceprojects
(Duckers, 2013; Jessop, 2007). Projects that have applied manual inspection at scale
(“GlobalXplorer”,2016;Linetal.,2014),struggledwith:(1)therecruitmentandretentionof
reliableparticipants(Waldetal.,2016;WestandPateman,2016),(2)thebiasesintroducedby
observers, and (3) the variability of naked-eye observations – problems that have only
increasedwiththescaleoftheresearch(Cowley,2012;Quintusetal.,2017;Sadr,2016).

visionwithdigitaleyes(Casana,2020).

Transferlearning
Ratherthantrainingourownmodelfromscratch,weusedapre-trainedCNN,atechnique
knownastransferlearning(Casinietal.,2022;Characteretal.,2021;Gallweyetal.,2019;see
alsoKadhimandAbed,2023;PanandYang,2010;Sechetal.,2023;foranoverviewseeWeiss
etal.,2016;Xiongetal.,2020).Transferlearningassumesthatlarge,complexmodelscanbe
pre-trainedusingdatafromonedomain,thenfine-tunedforaspecifictaskinanotherdomain.
TransferlearninghasbecomewidelyacceptedasastandardapproachtoMLproblemsin
areaslikecomputervisionandnaturallanguageprocessing(Ruderetal.,2019).Inthecaseof
transferlearningforimagedata,CNNsareoftenpre-trainedonasubsetofImageNet(Deng
etal.,2009),learningcombinationsofweightsandparameterswhichbestextractinformation
inordertomakepredictionsbetween1,000differentclassesofimage(Krizhevskyetal.,2012).
It isimportant to note thatwhat is being transferred isnot the ability todirectly classify
objectsormakepredictionsaboutthecontentsofimages.Instead,whatpre-trainedmodels
appear to learn is the ability to perform a kind of feature extraction. The weights and
parameters of the pre-trained CNN are used to extract dense, numerical vector
representations of images – objects known as image embeddings. These image
embeddings then act as the input to a classifier algorithm which learns to map between
theseabstractfeaturevectorsandtheprovidedlabels(Akataetal.,2015).
Weadoptedatransferlearningapproachforthisprojectforseveralreasons.First,pre-
trainedCNNssuchasVGG16(SimonyanandZisserman,2015),ResNet-50(Heetal.,2016),
andInception-V3(Szegedyetal.,2016)havebeenshowntoperformbetter(thanamanually-

burial mounds
Aftersomepreliminaryexperimentationwitharangeofdifferentpre-trainedmodels,we
concluded that ResNet-50 seemed to perform best for our data. This model is one of the
smaller pre-trained CNNs available, with only around 25.6m trainable parameters (for
comparison,VGG16hassome138.4m).TheResNetarchitecturehas,however,beenshownto
learnhighqualityimageembeddingsmoreeffectivelyduetotheuseofresiduallayers.The
model was deployed using TensorFlow 2 in Python (see the GitHub repositories by
Kristensen-McLachlanandMallon,2021,2022).
Duringinitial experiments, the model wasfound to overfit thetraining data, reporting
close to 100% accuracy after only a few training epochs. Overfitting in such an extreme
mannerresultsinamodelthatdoesnotgeneralisewelltonewdata(KadhimandAbed,2023),
meaningthatsuchaclassifierwouldnotbeuseful.Inordertocounterthisoverfitting,we
used proven data augmentation techniques to constrain model performance (Wang et al.,
2017).Dataaugmentationinvolvesmakingrandommodificationsandchangestothedata
during training, introducing noise and variability. The training data thus becomes more
difficulttolearnfrom,resultinginmodelsthatoverfitlessandproducingaclassifierthat

Assessment
Performance evaluation. The performance of the model was assessed using common
evaluationcriteria:WecalculatedF1scores,precision,recall,andaccuracy.Theseevaluation
metrics are the model’s own answers to the question “how well does the model predict
MOUND/NOTMOUNDinthetestdata,basedonwhatithaslearnedfromthetrainingdata?”

Many of the large undetected mounds, for example, fell on the edge of a tile. Second, an

Models have been observed to predict class membership based on incidental background

soughttoaddresstheproblem byretrainingthe modelusingmore prominentmounds that
hopefullystoodoutbetterfrombackgroundnoise.Thiscorrection,however,failedtoimprove
performance–indeed,itdeterioratedfurther.
Overall,trainingthemodelwithasetofhighlyvariablefeatureswithevenmorevaried
and complex backgrounds may have misled it regarding the target of detection. This
confusion likely arose from the variety of land cover on the surface of mounds and
surroundingthemounds,whichmayormaynotprovideacontrast(ormayprovidedifferent

Focusthepositivetrainingdata.Tocounterthetendencyofthemodeltodetectextraneous
background features, we could better focus the training data. Confronted with small and
varied features in noisy environments, Verschoof-van der Vaart et al. (2020, pp. 7–8), for
example,investedsomeeffortadjustingmodelparameterstoaccountfortargetfeaturesize.
Inourcase,tosteertheCNNawayfrom“readingthebackground”,wewouldlikelyneedto
resize each tile according to the recorded diameter of the mound. We could, for example,
specifyaparticularratio(determinedthroughexperimentation)betweenmoundandtilesize,
therebycontrollingthetargettobackgroundpixelratio.Thatwaywewouldendupwith
stamps of variable size containing minimal background noise. While this could be time-
consumingforfeaturesofvariableshapes,ourdatasetcontainsconsistentlycircularmounds
whosediameterwasmeasuredon-site.Theonlycomplicationisthatthemeasureddiameter
oftenvariesfromthediametervisibleintheimageduetoindistinctmoundboundaries.
Segment the training data. To address the problem of land-cover variability, we could

Segmentationoftrainingdataintorunsofbaremoundsinploughedfields,scrub-covered
moundsinploughedfields,baremoundsinmeadows,scrub-coveredmoundsinmeadows,
etc., would offer more consistency and might improve success rates. With all these
possibilities, however, we reduce the amount of training data for each run. We also risk

Each project must make a decision regarding the trade-offs of different approaches to
archaeological prospection using remotely sensed data, but the relevant literature
underreports failures, challenges, and limitations of ML when used for this application.
Very few projects, furthermore, report the time and resources invested in their approach,
whethermanualorautomated.AsMLapproachesbecomemorepopular,researchersneed
more negative examples, discussion of problems, and resourcing information to make
informed decisions about how to approach feature extraction from large remote-sensing
datasets.
