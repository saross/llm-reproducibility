  "changelog": {
    "2.4": "Added RDMAP objects (research_design, method, protocol) with three-tier hierarchy; extended claim_type with 'methodological_argument'; extended implicit_argument.type with Type 4 (design_assumption) and Type 5 (methodological_assumption); added reasoning approach framework (inductive/abductive/deductive); added research questions vs hypotheses distinction; integrated TIDieR and CONSORT-Outcomes frameworks as expected information checklists; added fieldwork-specific adaptations (opportunistic decisions, field condition responses); maintained architectural consistency with v2.3",
    "2.3": "Added consolidation_metadata to evidence, claims, and implicit arguments for traceability; added related_evidence field; enhanced claim structure with primary_function, claim_nature, quantitative_details; added 'synthesis' to claim_role enum; enhanced declared_uncertainty structure",
    "2.2": "Separated extraction-time vs assessment-time fields; added credibility_assessment structure; enhanced evidence_strength for extraction-time observations",
    "2.1": "Formalized Type 3 (disciplinary_assumption) extraction; added optional COI field to implicit arguments",
    "2.0": "Initial comprehensive schema with dual-layer uncertainty and four-level hierarchy",
    "2.5": "BREAKING CHANGE - Hallucination Prevention: Made verbatim_quote REQUIRED for evidence and claims; added trigger_text/trigger_locations/inference_reasoning REQUIRED for implicit arguments; set verbatim_quote to null for implicit arguments; added source_verification object to evidence, claims, and implicit arguments for Pass 3 validation"
