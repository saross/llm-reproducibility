# - M001: Hypothesis-driven factor selection
# - M002: Large-scale systematic pedestrian survey

# - M004: Ordered logit model estimation and simulation
# These describe distinct tactical approaches to different aspects of study

# Explicit:
# - P001: Variable selection for model
# - P002: Standardised mound recording procedure
# - P003: Elevation extraction from ASTER DEM
# - P004: Distance calculation using qGIS
# - P005: Ordered logit coefficient estimation
# - P006: Simulation procedure for changed circumstances
# - P007: Graphical representation of simulation results
# Implicit:
# - IP001: Personnel training procedure
# - IP002: Land-use classification criteria
# - IP003: Condition assessment procedure
#
# Review for potential consolidations:
# - P003 and P004 both describe GIS procedures but for different variables (elevation vs distance)
# - Keep separate as they use different tools/data sources
# - All other protocols describe distinct operational procedures
# Keep all separate
