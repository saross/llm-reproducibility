# RDMAP Extraction Prompt - PASS 2: Rationalization v2.5

**Version:** 2.5 Pass 2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Workflow Stage:** Pass 2 of 3 - Consolidate and refine Pass 1 RDMAP extraction  
**Skill Context:** This prompt is part of the research-assessor skill  
**Schema Update:** Added source verification for consolidations (v2.5)

---

## Your Task

Review Pass 1 RDMAP extraction and apply consolidation principles to produce rationalized, high-quality research designs, methods, and protocols. Pass 1 intentionally over-extracted (~40-50%). Your job is to consolidate, correct tier boundaries, and verify relationships.

**Input:** JSON extraction document with RDMAP arrays populated from Pass 1
- May also contain claims/evidence arrays from separate extraction

**Your responsibility:** Refine these arrays in place:
- `research_designs`
- `methods`
- `protocols`

**Leave untouched:**
- `evidence`, `claims`, `implicit_arguments` (rationalized separately)
- Any other arrays not your responsibility

**Output:** Same JSON document with RDMAP arrays rationalized

---

## Sourcing Discipline Reminder

Pass 2 consolidations must maintain v2.5 sourcing requirements established in Pass 1.

**Quick reminder** (see extraction-fundamentals.md for complete guidance):
- **Explicit RDMAP (status = "explicit"):** Must preserve or synthesize `verbatim_quote` from Methods section
- **Implicit RDMAP (status = "implicit"):** Must preserve all `trigger_text` passages + `trigger_locations`
- **Consolidation rule:** Combined items must maintain source integrity and status accuracy

When consolidating RDMAP items:
- Explicit items: Synthesized quotes must represent actual Methods content
- Implicit items: All trigger passages preserved, inference reasoning updated
- Status fields: Verify status still accurate after consolidation
- Most conservative confidence maintained

**For complete sourcing fundamentals:** → See `references/extraction-fundamentals.md`

## Quality Checklist for Pass 2

Use this checklist as your roadmap. Before finalizing:

- [ ] 15-20% reduction achieved (may vary by section type)
- [ ] All consolidations have complete consolidation_metadata
- [ ] **Source verification complete for consolidations**
- [ ] **Status fields preserved/corrected after consolidation**
- [ ] **Explicit items maintain verbatim_quote integrity**
- [ ] **Implicit items maintain trigger_text integrity**
- [ ] No information loss from consolidations
- [ ] No remaining redundancy (check for duplicate tool specs, repeated rationales)
- [ ] Tier assignments accurate (WHY → Design, WHAT → Method, HOW → Protocol)
- [ ] All cross-references bidirectional and valid
- [ ] RDMAP vs claims boundary accurate (descriptions vs arguments)
- [ ] Reasoning approach consistent (claimed vs inferred match)
- [ ] Expected information gaps flagged appropriately
- [ ] Location fields preserved through consolidation
- [ ] Other arrays (claims/evidence) untouched

**Research Design Count Check:**
- [ ] If <3 research designs: Review for under-extraction
  - Check Abstract/Intro/Methods for missed strategic decisions
  - Check: Meta-level framing (comparative evaluation, case study rationale) extracted?
  - Check: Theoretical frameworks recognized as RDs?
  - Check: Design rationale vs method description distinction maintained?
- [ ] If >10 research designs: Review for over-extraction (each RD needs independent justification)
- [ ] Quality over count - extract what's genuinely present

---

## Rationalization Philosophy

**Goals:**
- Reduce over-extraction to appropriate granularity (target 15-20% reduction)
- Correct tier assignment errors (WHY vs WHAT vs HOW)
- Consolidate redundant methodological descriptions
- Verify boundary accuracy (RDMAP vs claims)
- Validate all cross-references
- Complete expected information review

**Expected outcome:**
- 15-20% reduction in total items
- Better tier boundaries (Design vs Method vs Protocol)
- Appropriate consolidation without information loss
- All cross-references bidirectional and valid
- Complete traceability via metadata

**NOT expansion:** Pass 2 consolidates and refines. Do not add new items unless clearly missed in Pass 1.

---

## Core Consolidation Principles

**Follow the consolidation hierarchy defined in the skill and reference materials:**

### Consolidation Hierarchy

**For RDMAP Items:**

**PRIMARY:** Assessment Compatibility Test
- RDMAP items (designs, methods, protocols) don't have "support patterns" like evidence
- Use: *"Would I assess these TOGETHER or SEPARATELY?"*
- Design rationale synthesis: Together
- Workflow method sequences: Together if assessed as unified method
- Protocol specifications: Together if describing same tool/procedure
- Temporal comparisons: ALWAYS separate

**For detailed patterns and examples:**  
→ See `/mnt/skills/user/research-assessor/references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md`

**RDMAP-Specific Guidance:**

**Research Designs** (High-level consolidation appropriate)
- Consolidate multiple rationales for same decision
- Combine spatial/temporal/thematic scope statements
- Preserve distinct hypotheses (especially if different timing)

**Methods** (Moderate consolidation)
- Consolidate workflow sequences into unified methods
- Combine related validation procedures
- Keep different analytical approaches separate

**Protocols** (Minimal consolidation)
- Only consolidate truly redundant specifications
- Preserve measurement precision and parameters
- Keep distinct procedures separate

**CRITICAL:** Temporal comparisons (before/after, phase-by-phase) NEVER consolidate

**Quick workflow:**
```
Step 1: Apply assessment compatibility test (Would I assess together?)
Step 2: Check tier-specific guidance (Design/Method/Protocol)
Step 3: Verify no temporal comparison
Step 4: Document all consolidations with complete metadata
```

## RDMAP-Specific Consolidation Patterns

### Research Design Consolidation

**Conservative approach:** Research Designs generally stay separate (see consolidation-patterns.md for detailed rules).

**Key test:** "Could reviewers independently assess transparency of these decisions?"
- If YES → Keep separate (most cases)
- If NO → Consider consolidation

**Unlike Evidence:** Don't apply graph analysis. Preserve strategic decision granularity for assessment.

### Pattern 1: Design Rationale Synthesis
**Consolidate:** Multiple justifications for same design decision  
**Example:** Three separate rationale statements → unified comprehensive rationale  
**Type:** `rationale_synthesis`

### Pattern 2: Scope Definition Consolidation
**Consolidate:** Separate spatial/temporal/thematic scope statements  
**Example:** Location + time period + artifact types → complete scope definition  
**Type:** `scope_integration`

### Pattern 3: Workflow Method Aggregation
**Consolidate:** Sequential procedures forming unified method  
**Example:** Survey + observation + documentation + GPS recording → integrated survey method  
**Type:** `workflow_integration`  
**Note:** Keep as separate methods if assessed independently

### Pattern 4: Validation Chain Consolidation
**Consolidate:** Multiple QC steps forming comprehensive validation  
**Example:** Inter-coder reliability + member checking + peer debriefing → multi-faceted QC  
**Type:** `validation_chain`

### Pattern 5: Protocol Specification Consolidation
**Consolidate:** Redundant tool descriptions across protocols  
**Example:** GPS device + model + accuracy + datum → complete GPS specification  
**Type:** `tool_specification`

### Pattern 6: Parameter Aggregation
**Consolidate:** Related parameter settings for same protocol  
**Example:** Transect spacing + width + walking speed → complete transect parameters  
**Type:** `parameter_integration`

**Critical:** All consolidations must preserve quantitative values and replication-critical details

---

## Verification Tasks

### 1. Tier Assignment Verification

**Check each RDMAP item against tier criteria:**

**Research Design indicators:**
- Explains WHY research framed this way
- Contains research questions, hypotheses, theoretical frameworks
- Provides study design rationale
- Defines scope and boundaries

**Method indicators:**
- Explains WHAT was done at high level
- Describes data collection approach, sampling strategy, analysis technique
- General approach without implementation details

**Protocol indicators:**
- Explains HOW specifically implemented
- Contains exact procedures, tool configurations, parameter values
- Sufficient detail for replication

**If misclassified:** Move to correct tier and update cross-references

**For detailed tier assignment guidance:**  
→ See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md`

---

### 2. Cross-Reference Validation

**Verify bidirectional consistency for all cross-references:**

**Design → Method:**
- `research_designs[].enables_methods` ↔ `methods[].implements_designs`
- Check: Every enabled method references back to design

**Method → Protocol:**
- `methods[].realized_through_protocols` ↔ `protocols[].implements_methods`
- Check: Every used protocol references back to method
- Note: `implements_methods` is an array, e.g., `["M001"]` or `["M001", "M002"]`

**Method → Evidence/Claims:**
- `methods[].supports_claims` ↔ `claims[].supported_by_evidence`
- Verify method descriptions not making claims (boundary accuracy)

**After consolidation:** Update all affected cross-references

---

### 3. Boundary Accuracy Review

**RDMAP vs Claims distinction:**

**RDMAP (methodological descriptions):**
- ✓ "Used stratified random sampling with 30% coverage"
- ✓ "GPS coordinates recorded at ±3cm accuracy"
- ✓ "Inter-coder reliability testing with Cohen's kappa"

**Claims (assertions about effectiveness):**
- ✗ "Stratified sampling proved more efficient"
- ✗ "High-accuracy GPS enabled better site mapping"
- ✗ "Inter-coder reliability was excellent"

**Test:** "Is this describing HOW research was done, or ARGUING about how well it worked?"
- Describing → RDMAP
- Arguing → Move to claims array

---

### 4. Reasoning Approach Consistency

**For Research Designs, verify reasoning approach classification:**

**Check claimed vs inferred consistency:**
- If `explicit_statement` present → should match `inferred_approach`
- If mismatch → document in `extraction_notes`, flag for review

**Verify hypothesis timing inference:**
- Pre-data: Stated in Introduction/Methods before Results
- Post-data: First mentioned in Results/Discussion, or marked as "emerged"
- Check timing basis and confidence level

**Mixed vs Unclear distinction:**
- Mixed requires evidence of BOTH exploratory AND confirmatory
- Don't default to "mixed" - use "unclear" if insufficient information

---

### 5. Expected Information Review

**Flag missing information in `expected_information_missing` arrays:**

**Common gaps to check:**
- Sample size justification
- Tool specifications and versions
- Parameter settings and values
- Quality control procedures
- Alternative methods considered
- Stopping rules for data collection

**Don't penalize absence - just document for transparency assessment**

**For comprehensive domain-specific checklists:**  
→ See `references/checklists/expected-information.md`

---

## Consolidation Metadata (REQUIRED)

**ALL consolidated items MUST have complete consolidation_metadata:**

```json
"consolidation_metadata": {
  "consolidated_from": ["P1_RD003", "P1_RD004"],
  "consolidation_type": "identical_support_pattern | rationale_synthesis | scope_integration | workflow_integration | validation_chain | tool_specification | parameter_integration",
  "information_preserved": "complete | lossy_granularity | lossy_redundancy",
  "granularity_available": "Description of additional detail in source",
  "rationale": "Why consolidation appropriate"
}
```

**Information preservation values:**
- `complete`: No information lost
- `lossy_granularity`: Fine detail removed but aggregate preserved
- `lossy_redundancy`: Redundant statements merged

---

## Key Consolidation Examples

### Example 1: Good Consolidation (Preserves Detail)

**Pass 1 extracted:**
```json
{"method_id": "M025", "method_text": "Inter-coder reliability testing"},
{"method_id": "M026", "method_text": "Cohen's kappa calculated at 0.87"},
{"method_id": "M027", "method_text": "Member checking with team"}
```

**Pass 2 consolidated:**
```json
{
  "method_id": "M025",
  "method_text": "Multi-faceted quality control: inter-coder reliability testing (Cohen's kappa = 0.87) and member checking with survey team",
  "consolidation_metadata": {
    "consolidated_from": ["M025", "M026", "M027"],
    "consolidation_type": "validation_chain",
    "information_preserved": "complete",
    "rationale": "Related validation procedures combined into coherent QC approach"
  }
}
```

**Why good:** Preserves kappa value, maintains all validation methods, improves coherence

---

### Example 2: Bad Consolidation (Loses Critical Detail)

**Pass 1 extracted:**
```json
{"protocol_id": "P035", "protocol_text": "GPS coordinates at ±3cm accuracy"},
{"protocol_id": "P036", "protocol_text": "RTK correction for high precision"}
```

**Bad Pass 2:**
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "P035",
  "protocol_text": "GPS coordinates with high precision"  // Lost ±3cm and RTK!
}
```

**Correct Pass 2:**
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "P035",
  "protocol_text": "GPS coordinates at ±3cm accuracy using RTK correction",
  "consolidation_metadata": {
    "consolidated_from": ["P035", "P036"],
    "consolidation_type": "parameter_integration",
    "information_preserved": "complete"
  }
}
```

**Critical:** Never lose quantitative values or replication-critical specifications

---

### Example 3: Tier-Specific Granularity

**Design (high-level):**
```json
// Consolidate multiple rationales
"rationale": "Comparative design enables direct assessment of platform effectiveness, recording quality differences, and follows standard mobile technology evaluation practice"
```

**Method (moderate):**
```json
// Consolidate workflow but preserve approach distinctness
"data_collection_approach": {
  "approach": "survey",
  "domain_specific_type": "pedestrian archaeological survey with integrated documentation"
}
```

**Protocol (detailed):**
```json
// Minimal consolidation, preserve specifications
"tools": [{
  "tool_name": "Garmin GPSMAP 64s",
  "specifications": {"accuracy": "±3cm with RTK", "datum": "WGS84"}
}]
```

---

## Consolidation Workflow

### STEP 1: Tier Verification
- Check Design/Method/Protocol classifications
- Move misclassified items to correct tier
- Update cross-references after moves

### STEP 2: Consolidation
- Apply acid test to identify consolidation opportunities
- Use RDMAP-specific patterns where appropriate
- Document all consolidations with complete metadata
- Preserve quantitative values and critical parameters

**🚨 Source Verification (REQUIRED)**

**For ALL items (consolidated or not), verify:**

1. **Consolidation integrity** (if item was consolidated):
   - Verbatim_quote/trigger_text preserves or synthesizes source appropriately
   - No information invented
   - Most conservative confidence maintained

2. **Quote compliance** (all explicit items):
   - Read if uncertain: `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`
   - Complete sentences only (no mid-sentence fragments)
   - Exact text from paper (no paraphrasing)
   - Verify quote exists: "Can I find this EXACT text in paper?"

3. **Multi-location sourcing** (any item with discontinuous sources):
   - **If item draws from multiple distinct locations → include quotes/trigger_text from ALL locations**
   - This applies to: consolidated methods, cross-subsection implicit designs, synthesized protocols
   - Document all locations in source_location/trigger_locations
   - Example: Method described in both Methods and Results needs verbatim_quote/trigger_text from both locations

4. **Fix if needed:**
   - Missing sentence start → Add context to complete sentence
   - Paraphrased text → Replace with actual verbatim text
   - Incomplete multi-location sourcing → Add missing quotes/trigger_text
   - Quote not found → Locate and update
   - Cannot verify → Mark `extraction_confidence: "low"` with note

**Adding implicit RDMAP in Pass 2:**

Pass 2 may identify implicit RDMAP items missed in Pass 1, particularly:
- **Cross-subsection synthesis** - Method implied across multiple sections
- **Overlooked implicit content** - Protocol mentioned but not described
- **Comparative designs** - Design rationale implied but not stated

**If adding implicit RDMAP in Pass 2:**
1. Must have `trigger_text` array with verbatim passages
2. Must have `trigger_locations` for each passage
3. Must have `inference_reasoning` explaining the inference
4. Must have complete `implicit_metadata` object
5. Must explain in extraction_notes why missed in Pass 1

**Verification Reference:**

**For detailed verification procedures:**  
→ See `references/verification-procedures.md`

**Pass 2 verification focuses:**
- Consolidated items preserve source integrity
- No information invented during consolidation
- Status fields (explicit/implicit) remain accurate after consolidation
- Trigger_text and verbatim_quotes updated appropriately

**Remember:** Pass 2 consolidates and refines, but maintains same sourcing discipline established in Pass 1.

### STEP 3: Cross-Reference Validation
- Verify bidirectional consistency
- Update references after consolidation
- Check design → method → protocol chains
- Validate method → claim boundaries

### STEP 4: Boundary and Consistency Checks
- Verify RDMAP vs claims boundary
- Check reasoning approach consistency
- Review hypothesis timing inference
- Flag expected information gaps

### STEP 5: Quality Verification
- No information loss (or documented as lossy)
- No remaining redundancy
- All consolidation_metadata complete
- Location fields preserved
- Other arrays (claims/evidence) untouched
