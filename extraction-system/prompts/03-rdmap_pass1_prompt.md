# RDMAP Extraction Prompt - PASS 1: Explicit Extraction v2.5

**Version:** 2.5 Pass 1
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Workflow Stage:** Pass 1 of 4 - Explicit RDMAP extraction (implicit extraction in Pass 1b)
**Skill Context:** This prompt is part of the research-assessor skill
**Schema Update:** Added mandatory sourcing to prevent hallucination

---

## Your Task

Extract **explicit RDMAP items** from research paper Methods/Approach sections: strategic decisions, methods, and protocols that are documented with procedural details.

**This is Pass 1: Liberal Extraction** - when uncertain about tier assignment or boundaries, err on the side of inclusion. Pass 2 will consolidate and rationalise.

**Input:** JSON extraction document (schema v2.5)
- May be blank template (starting fresh)
- May be partially populated (if claims/evidence already extracted)

**Your responsibility:** Populate these arrays with EXPLICIT items:
- `research_designs` (set `design_status = "explicit"`)
- `methods` (set `method_status = "explicit"`)
- `protocols` (set `protocol_status = "explicit"`)

**Leave untouched:**
- `evidence`, `claims`, `implicit_arguments` (extracted separately)
- Any other arrays already populated

**What you're extracting:**
- **Research Designs** - Strategic decisions about WHY research was framed this way
- **Methods** - Tactical approaches about WHAT was done at high level
- **Protocols** - Operational procedures about HOW specifically it was done

**Note:** Implicit RDMAP items (mentioned but undocumented, or inferred from Results/Discussion) will be extracted in Pass 1b (separate prompt). This pass focuses solely on documented methodology in Methods section.

**Output:** Same JSON document with explicit RDMAP arrays populated

## üö® CRITICAL: Verbatim Quote Requirements

**Before extracting any item:**

Read if uncertain: `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`

**Non-negotiable rules for all `verbatim_quote` fields:**

1. **Complete sentences only** - Extract whole grammatical units, never mid-sentence fragments
2. **Exact text only** - Copy-paste from paper, never paraphrase or reconstruct from memory
3. **Verify before committing** - Ensure exact quote exists in paper before adding to JSON
4. **Single source only** - Never synthesise quotes from multiple locations

**Self-check:** "Can I find this EXACT text string in the paper with simple search?"
- If YES ‚Üí Extract it
- If NO ‚Üí Quote is wrong; fix it or skip (will be captured in Pass 1b if implicit)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Failure to follow these rules causes 40-50% validation failures in Pass 3.**

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Explicit RDMAP Sourcing

**READ FIRST:** `references/extraction-fundamentals.md`

The fundamentals document covers universal sourcing requirements that apply to all object types. **RDMAP items have the same sourcing discipline as Evidence and Claims.**

### Explicit RDMAP Definition

**EXPLICIT = Documented in Methods section with procedural details**
- Strategic decisions described with rationale
- Methods described with approach specifications
- Protocols described with operational steps
- Extract with `verbatim_quote` field from Methods/Approach section
- Status: `design_status`, `method_status`, or `protocol_status` = `"explicit"`

**Decision rule for this pass:**
```
Is this RDMAP item described in the Methods section with procedural details?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Extract as explicit (this pass)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Skip (will be extracted in Pass 1b if implicit)
```

## RDMAP Tier Hierarchy

Research Designs ‚Üí Methods ‚Üí Protocols (strategic ‚Üí tactical ‚Üí operational)

**Research Designs** are strategic decisions answering "WHY this approach?"
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Study designs (comparative evaluation, case study, experimental design)
- Theoretical frameworks guiding the research
- Sampling frames (WHAT to sample from)

**Methods** are tactical approaches answering "WHAT was done?"
- Data collection approaches (observation, measurement, recording)
- Sampling strategies (HOW to sample)
- Analysis methods (statistical tests, qualitative coding, spatial analysis)
- Validation and quality control approaches

**Protocols** are operational procedures answering "HOW SPECIFICALLY was it done?"
- Step-by-step procedures
- Tool configurations and parameters
- Recording and data capture procedures
- Processing and transformation procedures

**See:** `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` for complete classification guidance

## Liberal Extraction Philosophy

This is Pass 1: **LIBERAL EXTRACTION**

**When uncertain:**
- About tier (design vs method vs protocol): **INCLUDE IT** (Pass 2 will rationalise)
- About boundaries (one item or two): **EXTRACT BOTH** (Pass 2 will consolidate)
- About whether it qualifies as RDMAP: **INCLUDE IT** (Pass 2 will review)

**Accept 40-50% over-extraction:**
- Pass 1 should over-capture
- Pass 2 consolidates and rationalises
- Better to extract too much than miss assessment-critical information

**When to extract "high-level" or "obvious" designs:**
- "Comparative evaluation of X vs Y" feels obvious? ‚Üí EXTRACT IT (it's a strategic choice)
- "Case study to demonstrate Z" feels obvious? ‚Üí EXTRACT IT (case study is a design decision)
- Meta-level framing that shapes entire paper ‚Üí EXTRACT IT (these are Research Designs)

---

## Step 0: Pre-Scan for Research Designs

Before extracting RDMAP, quickly scan Abstract, Introduction, Background, and Methods/Approach sections for design elements:
- Mark decision language ("chose," "selected," "because")
- Mark frameworks ("guided by," "framework," "informed by")
- Mark meta-level framing (comparative evaluation, case study rationale, efficiency hypothesis)

See: `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` for detailed pre-scan checklist.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-Scan Mindset:** If a design element feels "too obvious" or "everyone knows this" ‚Üí Mark it anyway. Meta-level designs (comparative evaluation, case study rationale) feel obvious because they frame the entire paper - that's exactly why they're Research Designs.

---

## Step 1: Extract Explicit Research Designs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Literature Review Warning:** Don't extract Research Designs from descriptions of PRIOR work.
- If verbatim quote says "Smith et al. employed..." ‚Üí Not current paper's design
- If quote says "We build on comparative approaches..." ‚Üí Check: Do they explain WHY they chose it for THIS study?
- Test: Does this explain a strategic choice the AUTHORS made, or describe what others did?

**Scan Abstract, Introduction, Background, and Methods/Approach sections for documented strategic decisions:**

**Look for design language:**
- Decision markers: "chose," "selected," "opted for," "decision to"
- Rationale markers: "because," "rationale," "reasoning"
- Purpose markers: "aimed to," "sought to," "designed to"
- Framework markers: "framework," "guided by," "informed by"
- Comparison markers: "compared," "evaluated," "tested whether"

See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` for full patterns.

**For each explicit design found:**
- Extract complete strategic decision with rationale
- Set `design_status = "explicit"`
- Extract `verbatim_quote` from paper
- Classify reasoning approach for each
- **Identify each distinct strategic decision point** (separate rationales = separate designs)
- Extract theoretical frameworks as Research Designs

**Meta-level framing:** Papers often have strategic designs that frame entire research:
- "Comparative evaluation of X" ‚Üí Design (comparison AS strategic choice)
- "Case study to demonstrate Y" ‚Üí Design (case study AS deliberate decision)

Extract these even though they seem "obvious" - they're strategic choices requiring independent justification.

**Systematically check:** For each major section, ask: questions stated? hypotheses stated? frameworks referenced? design rationale explained? See `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` for complete checklist.

**Liberal extraction:** Include "high-level" design elements - critical for transparency assessment.

---

## Step 2: Extract Explicit Methods

**Scan Methods/Approach section for documented tactical approaches:**

**Look for method types:**
- Data collection approaches (recording, measurement, observation)
- Sampling strategies (systematic, random, purposive, stratified)
- Analysis methods (statistical tests, qualitative coding, spatial analysis)
- Quality control approaches (validation, verification, cross-checking)

**For each explicit method found:**
- Extract high-level approach with context
- Set `method_status = "explicit"`
- Extract `verbatim_quote` from Methods section
- Document expected missing information
- When uncertain about tier: **INCLUDE IT** (Pass 2 will consolidate)

**Systematically check:** For each subsection of Methods, ask: data collection described? sampling described? analysis approach described? quality control described?

**Liberal extraction:** Include borderline items (might be method or protocol) - Pass 2 will rationalise tier assignments.

---

## Step 3: Extract Explicit Protocols

**Scan Methods/Approach section for documented operational procedures:**

**Look for protocol types:**
- Recording procedures (how data was captured)
- Measurement procedures (how observations were made)
- Processing procedures (how data was cleaned, transformed, aggregated)
- Validation procedures (how quality was checked)
- Configuration procedures (how tools/equipment were set up)

**For each explicit protocol found:**
- Extract specific operational procedure
- Set `protocol_status = "explicit"`
- Extract `verbatim_quote` from Methods section
- Record procedure steps if specified
- Document parameters if specified
- Note expected missing information

**Protocol characteristics:**
- More specific than methods (implementation detail)
- Often includes parameters, settings, or step sequences
- Answers "how specifically" rather than "what approach"

**Systematically check:** For each method extracted, ask: are implementation procedures described? Are tool configurations specified? Are parameters documented?

**Liberal extraction:** Include procedural details even if incomplete - captures what WAS documented for transparency assessment.

---

## Relationship Mapping

**After extracting RDMAP items, map relationships:**

**Designs ‚Üí Methods:**
- Which methods implement/realise which research designs?
- Use `implements_designs` field in methods

**Methods ‚Üí Protocols:**
- Which protocols implement/realise which methods?
- Use `implements_methods` field in protocols

**Protocols ‚Üí Methods:**
- Reverse reference from protocol perspective
- Use `realized_through_protocols` field in methods

**Cross-tier connections:**
- Research Designs may directly connect to protocols
- Some designs validate specific claims
- Document these relationships in appropriate fields

**Liberal approach:** When uncertain about relationships, include them. Pass 2 will review.

---

## Expected Missing Information

**For EVERY RDMAP item, document what's missing:**

This is assessment-critical. Use `expected_information_missing` arrays to note:

**For Research Designs:**
- Missing rationale or justification
- Alternatives not discussed
- Theoretical framework not specified

**For Methods:**
- Missing procedural details
- Sample size not justified
- Quality control not described

**For Protocols:**
- Parameters not specified
- Tool configurations not documented
- Validation procedures missing

**This information feeds transparency assessment.** Be thorough about documenting gaps.

---
