# RDMAP Extraction Prompt - PASS 1: Liberal Extraction v2.5

**Version:** 2.5 Pass 1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Workflow Stage:** Pass 1 of 3 - Liberal RDMAP extraction with over-capture strategy  
**Skill Context:** This prompt is part of the research-assessor skill  
**Schema Update:** Added mandatory sourcing (explicit/implicit distinction) to prevent hallucination

---

## Your Task

Extract Research Design, Methods, and Protocols (RDMAP) from research paper sections. This is **Pass 1: Liberal Extraction** - when uncertain about tier assignment or boundaries, err on the side of inclusion. Pass 2 will consolidate and rationalize.

**Input:** JSON extraction document (schema v2.5)
- May be blank template (starting fresh)
- May be partially populated (if claims/evidence already extracted)

**Your responsibility:** Populate these arrays:
- `research_designs`
- `methods`
- `protocols`

**Leave untouched:**
- `evidence`, `claims`, `implicit_arguments` (extracted separately)
- Any other arrays already populated

**What you're extracting:**
- **Research Designs** - Strategic decisions about WHY research was framed this way
- **Methods** - Tactical approaches about WHAT was done at high level
- **Protocols** - Operational procedures about HOW specifically it was done

**Output:** Same JSON document with RDMAP arrays populated

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Verbatim Quote Requirements

**Before extracting any item:**

Read if uncertain: `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md`

**Non-negotiable rules for all `verbatim_quote` fields:**

1. **Complete sentences only** - Extract whole grammatical units, never mid-sentence fragments
2. **Exact text only** - Copy-paste from paper, never paraphrase or reconstruct from memory  
3. **Verify before committing** - Ensure exact quote exists in paper before adding to JSON
4. **Single source only** - Never synthesize quotes from multiple locations

**Self-check:** "Can I find this EXACT text string in the paper with simple search?"
- If YES ‚Üí Extract it
- If NO ‚Üí Quote is wrong; fix it or mark as implicit

‚ö†Ô∏è **Failure to follow these rules causes 40-50% validation failures in Pass 3.**

---

## üö® CRITICAL: RDMAP Sourcing Requirements

**READ FIRST:** `references/extraction-fundamentals.md`

The fundamentals document covers universal sourcing requirements that apply to all object types. **RDMAP items have the same sourcing discipline as Evidence and Claims.**

### RDMAP-Specific: Explicit vs Implicit Status

**EXPLICIT = Documented in Methods section**
- Procedural details provided with sufficient description
- Extract with `verbatim_quote` field
- Status: `design_status`, `method_status`, or `protocol_status` = `"explicit"`

**IMPLICIT = Not documented in Methods section**
- May be mentioned elsewhere without procedures (Results/Discussion)
- May be inferred from outcomes or comparisons
- Extract with `trigger_text` + `trigger_locations` + `inference_reasoning` + `implicit_metadata`
- Status: `design_status`, `method_status`, or `protocol_status` = `"implicit"`

**Decision rule:**
```
Is this RDMAP item described in the Methods section?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Status = "explicit", extract with verbatim_quote
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Are there passages elsewhere that imply it existed?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Status = "implicit", extract with trigger_text
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí DO NOT EXTRACT (absent, not implicit)
```

**Basis classification for implicit RDMAP:**
- **mentioned_undocumented**: Paper mentions item but doesn't describe procedures
  - Example: "Data were cleaned" but no cleaning procedure described
- **inferred_from_results**: Never mentioned but implied by outcomes
  - Example: Results show quality metrics but quality control never mentioned

**Note:** Implicit status documents transparency gaps for assessment. It does NOT mean "bad methodology" - many legitimate decisions may not be fully documented.

## Extraction Philosophy

**When uncertain about tier assignment, inclusion, or boundaries: INCLUDE IT.**

- Better to over-extract and consolidate later than miss important methodological information
- Preserve granularity - Pass 2 will consolidate appropriately
- Accept 40-50% over-extraction as expected and manageable
- Focus on comprehensive capture, not perfect classification

**You will NOT be penalized for:**
- Extracting too many items (Pass 2 consolidates)
- Being overly granular (Pass 2 lumps related items)
- Including items at multiple tiers when uncertain
- Marking uncertain boundaries

**You WILL be penalized for:**
- Missing important methodological information
- Under-extracting due to uncertainty
- Being too conservative about inclusion
- **Extracting RDMAP items without proper sourcing (verbatim_quote OR trigger_text)**

---

## Core Decision Framework

### 1. Three-Tier Hierarchy: Design ‚Üí Methods ‚Üí Protocols

**Quick Test:**
- **WHY** research was framed this way ‚Üí Research Design
- **WHAT** general approach was used ‚Üí Method
- **HOW** specifically implemented ‚Üí Protocol

**When uncertain:** Extract at BOTH levels and mark as uncertain in `extraction_notes`

**For complete decision tree, tier indicators, and boundary guidance:**
‚Üí See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md`

---

### 2. Description vs Argumentation Boundary

**Test:** "Is this describing HOW research was done, or ARGUING about how well it worked?"
- Describing HOW ‚Üí RDMAP
- Arguing about effectiveness ‚Üí Claims/Evidence

**If combined:** Extract description in RDMAP, assertion in claims, cross-reference them

**For complete boundary guidance with examples:**
‚Üí See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` (Description vs Argumentation Boundary section)

---

### 3. Reasoning Approach & Hypothesis Timing

**For Research Designs:** Classify reasoning approach (inductive, abductive, deductive, mixed, unclear) and assess hypothesis timing (pre-data vs post-data)

**Critical for assessment:** Detecting HARKing (Hypothesising After Results are Known), transparency evaluation

**For complete classification framework, hypothesis timing indicators, and verification procedures:**
‚Üí See `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` (Sections 9-10: Reasoning Approach Classification and Research Questions vs Hypotheses)

---

### 4. Expected Information & Missing Elements

For each RDMAP item, consider what information SHOULD be present but is MISSING.

**Use the `expected_information_missing` field to document gaps:**
- Don't penalize - just document
- Helps assess transparency and replicability
- Context-dependent (archaeology ‚â† biology ‚â† ethnography)

**For comprehensive checklists covering:**
- Method documentation (TIDieR-adapted)
- Measurement specifications (CONSORT-adapted)
- Sampling strategies
- Analysis methods
- Domain-specific expectations (archaeology, biology, ethnography)

**‚Üí See `references/checklists/expected-information.md`**

**Common missing elements to watch for:**
- Sample size justification
- Tool/equipment specifications
- Parameter settings
- Quality control procedures
- Alternative methods considered
- Stopping rules for sampling

**Note:** Expected information is separate from implicit status. An explicit (documented) method can still be missing expected details. Implicit methods automatically have higher expected information gaps since they're not documented at all.

---

### 5. Fieldwork-Specific Considerations

**For fieldwork-based research:** Recognise opportunistic decisions, contingency plans, and emergent discoveries

**For complete fieldwork patterns and extraction guidance:**
‚Üí See `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` (Section 11: Fieldwork-Specific Considerations)

---

### 6. Cross-Referencing

**Populate bidirectional links:**
- Research Designs `enables_methods` ‚Üí Methods `implements_designs`
- Methods `realized_through_protocols` ‚Üí Protocols `implements_methods`
- Methods `supports_claims` ‚Üê Claims `supported_by_evidence`

**Don't over-reference:** Only link if there's a clear relationship

**Complete in Step 4** of workflow (after extracting all RDMAP items)

---

## Extraction Workflow

### Step 0: Pre-Scan for Research Designs (2-3 minutes)

Before extracting RDMAP, quickly scan Abstract, Introduction, Background, and Methods/Approach sections for design elements:
- Mark decision language ("chose," "selected," "because")
- Mark frameworks ("guided by," "framework," "informed by")
- Mark meta-level framing (comparative evaluation, case study rationale, efficiency hypothesis)

See: `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` for detailed pre-scan checklist.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-Scan Mindset:** If a design element feels "too obvious" or "everyone knows this" ‚Üí Mark it anyway. Meta-level designs (comparative evaluation, case study rationale) feel obvious because they frame the entire paper - that's exactly why they're Research Designs.

**For systematic implicit RDMAP recognition patterns:**
‚Üí See `references/extraction-fundamentals.md` (Implicit RDMAP Extraction section)
- Covers 4 recognition patterns: Mentioned Procedure, Effects Implying Causes, Mentions Without Descriptions, Strategic Decisions
- Section-by-section extraction workflow for finding implicit RDMAP items
- Common mistakes to avoid

### Step 1: Identify Research Designs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Literature Review Warning:** Don't extract Research Designs from descriptions of PRIOR work.
- If verbatim quote says "Smith et al. employed..." ‚Üí Not current paper's design
- If quote says "We build on comparative approaches..." ‚Üí Check: Do they explain WHY they chose it for THIS study?
- Test: Does this explain a strategic choice the AUTHORS made, or describe what others did?

- Scan Abstract, Introduction, Background, and Methods/Approach sections systematically. RDs appear where they appear - don't prioritize sections.

**Scan for design language:**
- Decision: "chose," "selected," "opted for," "decision to"
- Rationale: "because," "rationale," "reasoning"
- Purpose: "aimed to," "sought to," "designed to"
- Framework: "framework," "guided by," "informed by"
- Comparison: "compared," "evaluated," "tested whether"

See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` for full patterns.

**Systematically check:** For each major section, ask: questions stated? hypotheses stated? frameworks referenced? design rationale explained? See `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` for complete checklist.

- **Identify each distinct strategic decision point** (separate rationales = separate designs)
- Extract theoretical frameworks as Research Designs

**Meta-level framing:** Papers often have strategic designs that frame entire research:
- "Comparative evaluation of X" ‚Üí Design (comparison AS strategic choice)
- "Case study to demonstrate Y" ‚Üí Design (case study AS deliberate decision)
Extract these even though they seem "obvious" - they're strategic choices requiring independent justification.

- Classify reasoning approach for each
- Determine explicit vs implicit status
- Populate verbatim_quote OR trigger_text appropriately
- **Liberal extraction:** Include "high-level" design elements - critical for transparency assessment

### Step 2: Identify Methods
- Look for data collection approaches
- Extract sampling strategies
- Identify analysis methods
- Note quality control and validation approaches
- Determine explicit vs implicit status for each method
- Populate verbatim_quote OR trigger_text + implicit_metadata
- Document expected missing information
- **When uncertain about tier or inclusion: INCLUDE IT**

### Step 3: Identify Protocols
- Find specific procedures with implementation detail
- Extract tool specifications and configurations
- Capture parameter settings and values
- Document recording standards and decision rules
- Note measurement protocols
- Determine explicit vs implicit status for each protocol
- Populate verbatim_quote OR trigger_text + implicit_metadata
- **When uncertain: INCLUDE IT**

### Step 4: Cross-Reference
- Link designs to methods they enable
- Link methods to protocols they use
- Verify bidirectional consistency
- Update `implements_designs` and `implements_methods` fields

**Protocol-method linking (CRITICAL):**
- `implements_methods` is an ARRAY of method IDs (plural, not singular)
- Protocol implements ONE method: `"implements_methods": ["M001"]`
- Protocol implements MULTIPLE methods: `"implements_methods": ["M001", "M002"]`
- All protocols should link to at least one method (prevents orphaned protocols)

### Step 5: Flag Missing Information
- Review each RDMAP item against expected information
- Populate `expected_information_missing` arrays
- Document in `extraction_notes` if significant gaps
- Don't penalize - just document for transparency
