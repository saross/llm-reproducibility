## Quality Control Targets

### Sourcing Discipline
- **100% sourcing requirement**: Every item must have page number + line number (where applicable)
- **Verbatim quotes**: Required for all explicit claims/evidence with direct quotations
- **Trigger text**: Required for all implicit items to document inference basis

### Cross-Reference Integrity
- Evidence items must reference related claims (bidirectional)
- Methods must reference related research designs
- Protocols must reference related methods
- Minimum 85% cross-reference completeness

### RDMAP Three-Tier Verification
- Every method must link to at least one research design (WHY â WHAT)
- Every protocol must link to at least one method (WHAT â HOW)
- No orphaned items (check for isolated nodes)

### Implicit Item Threshold
- Target: 20-25% of claims should be implicit (requiring interpretive inference)
- Target: 15-20% of RDMAP items should be implicit
- Evidence: primarily explicit (should be <10% implicit)

---

## Anticipated Challenges

### 1. Statistical Methods Complexity
- Multiple statistical techniques with technical terminology (DCA, Ward's cluster analysis, indicator species analysis)
- **Strategy**: Extract both the conceptual method and computational protocols separately
- **Cross-reference**: Link statistical choices to research questions about vegetation development

### 2. Multi-Proxy Integration
- Results from different analytical methods (pollen, charcoal, magnetics, NPPs) need careful attribution
- **Strategy**: Track proxy type explicitly in evidence items
- **Metadata**: Add proxy_type field to evidence items (pollen/charcoal/magnetic/NPP)

### 3. Chronological Complexity
- 13 radiocarbon dates with calibration uncertainties and Bayesian modelling
- Excluded dates and model agreement statistics
- **Strategy**: Extract raw dates, calibrated ages, and modelled ages as separate evidence items
- **Cross-reference**: Link dates to specific depth intervals and vegetation phases

### 4. Regional Synthesis Section
- Cluster analysis incorporates data from 14+ external pollen sites across Bulgaria
- **Strategy**: Focus on Straldzha interpretations; extract synthesis claims but don't duplicate full datasets from cited papers
- **Boundary**: Extract comparative claims but not the complete datasets of external sites

### 5. Interdisciplinary Integration
- Archaeological settlement data integrated with palaeoecological evidence (especially section 4.3)
- **Strategy**: Extract archaeological evidence items when directly used to support environmental claims
- **Boundary**: Focus on palaeoecological-archaeological connections, not purely archaeological interpretations

### 6. Implicit Research Designs
- Study design elements scattered across Introduction, Methods, and Discussion
- **Strategy**: Pass 4 will be critical for capturing overarching design rationale from Discussion context
- **Alert**: Watch for implicit methodological choices in vegetation phase interpretations and climate-agriculture connections

### 7. Vegetation Phase Terminology
- Five named palaeovegetation phases used throughout (Cold steppe, Semidesert, Forest-steppe, Oak woods, Deforestation)
- **Strategy**: Maintain consistent terminology in all items
- **Create controlled vocabulary** for phase names to ensure consistency

---

## Workflow Execution Notes

### Pass 1 Strategy
- Section-by-section extraction following order above (Sections 1-13)
- Mark uncertain items with [UNCERTAIN] flag for Pass 2 review
- Over-extract boundary cases (liberal approach, 40-50% over)
- Track vegetation phase names/chronology for consistent terminology
- Create controlled vocabulary file for phase names and chronological boundaries

### Pass 2-3 Transition
- After rationalising claims/evidence, begin RDMAP with Methods section re-read
- Build RDMAP hierarchy bottom-up: extract protocols first, then group into methods
- Complete methods layer before extracting research designs

### Pass 3 Equal Attention Strategy
- **CRITICAL**: Research designs commonly under-extracted
- Scan ALL 13 sections, not just Methods:
  - Introduction: Design rationale, research questions
  - Methods: Implementation details
  - Discussion: Design reflection, synthesis approach
- Cast especially wide net for research designs (40-50% over-extraction)

### Pass 4 Focus Areas
- Re-read Introduction + Discussion for implicit research design elements
- Check Methods for unstated procedural decisions (e.g., why 200 pollen minimum? why specific DCA parameters?)
- Review Results-Discussion transitions for implicit interpretive methods
- Look for "standard procedures" mentions without specification

### Pass 5 Priorities
- Check for protocol over-granularity (e.g., "added 10% HCl" vs. "acid washing step")
- Consolidate similar methods with slight variations (e.g., different sampling intervals for quarry vs. core)
- Verify research design hierarchy makes sense at conceptual level
- Ensure 8-10 research designs remain (don't over-consolidate)

### Validation Checkpoints
- After Pass 2: Verify no duplicate claims with identical verbatim_quote
- After Pass 3: Check all methods have â¥1 protocol child, all protocols link to â¥1 method
- After Pass 4: Verify research designs cover all three main research questions
- After Pass 5: Run final cross-reference completeness check (target 85%+)

## Timeline Estimate

| Pass | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Metadata extraction | 2-3 min |
| 1 | Liberal claims/evidence (13 sections) | 5-7 hours |
| 2 | Rationalize claims/evidence | 2-3 hours |
| 3 | Liberal RDMAP (13 sections) | 4-6 hours |
| 4 | Implicit RDMAP | 1.5-2 hours |
| 5 | Rationalize RDMAP | 2-3 hours |
| 6 | Validation & repair | 45-60 min |
| 7 | Summary generation | 20-30 min |
| **Total** | **Complete extraction** | **16-22 hours** |

Note: Longer than typical due to paper length (44 pages main text), statistical complexity, and 13-section structure.

## Notes on This Paper's Value as a Model

This paper represents an excellent model for:

1. **Multi-proxy integration**: Demonstrates how to extract and cross-reference findings from multiple analytical methods (pollen, charcoal, magnetics, NPPs)

2. **Statistical complexity**: Shows how to handle quantitative analytical techniques (DCA, cluster analysis, Bayesian modelling, indicator species analysis)

3. **Interdisciplinary synthesis**: Models extraction from studies bridging palaeoecology and archaeology

4. **Regional comparison**: Demonstrates extraction from papers synthesising multiple datasets/sites (14+ pollen records)

5. **Hierarchical RDMAP**: Clear three-tier structure from conceptual design (why investigate vegetation response?) through methods (what proxies?) to protocols (how to extract/count?)

6. **Chronological modelling**: Shows extraction of complex age-depth modelling with radiocarbon dating, calibration, and Bayesian analysis

7. **Section chunking**: Demonstrates subdivision of long Discussion section (originally ~6500 words) into manageable sections (850-1500 words each) at natural subsection boundaries

**Recommended for**: Training on complex, multi-method, interdisciplinary palaeoenvironmental papers with statistical analysis and regional synthesis components.

## Chunking Strategy Demonstration

**Original Problem**: Discussion section contained two oversized sections:
- Original Section 7: "Discussion Part 1 - Vegetation History" (~4500 words, pages 13-24)
- Original Section 8: "Discussion Part 2 - Human Impact & Conclusions" (~2000 words, pages 25-29)

**Solution**: Split at natural subsection boundaries following the paper's own structure:

**Section 7 split into 4 sections** (pages 13-22):
- Section 6: Discussion intro + Cold steppe phase (4.1.1) - 900 words
- Section 7: Semidesert phase (4.1.2) - 1300 words
- Section 8: Forest-steppe phase (4.1.3) - 1200 words
- Section 9: Oak woods + Deforestation (4.1.4-5) - 1200 words

**Section 8 split into 3 sections** (pages 22-29):
- Section 10: Regional vegetation model (4.2) - 1500 words
- Section 11: Climate and agricultural spread (4.3 part 1) - 850 words
- Section 12: Neolithic to Bronze Age impacts (4.3 part 2) - 1200 words

**Result**: All 13 sections now â¤1500 words, with natural boundaries following the paper's subsection structure.

**Key lesson**: When sections exceed 1500 words, look for the paper's own subsection headings as natural split points.
