Section-by-Section RDMAP Extraction Template

Demonstrates extracting BOTH explicit and implicit RDMAP from a single section.
Adapt for each section: Abstract+Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion.

Key principle:
Each section extraction must capture BOTH:
1. EXPLICIT RDMAP - documented/clearly stated procedures
2. IMPLICIT RDMAP - mentioned procedures without procedural detail

Common failure mode: Only extracting explicit items, missing implicit ones.
This causes zero implicit RDMAP in final extraction.

Recognition patterns for implicit RDMAP:
- VERBS without procedures: cleaned, validated, checked, assigned, corrected
- EFFECTS implying causes: "performance degraded" â†’ monitoring protocol
- MENTIONS without descriptions: "assigned maps" â†’ assignment protocol
