# Task Report: Research Assessor Skill Validation & Workflow Definition

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** Review packaged skill from previous conversation, correct issues, define packaging workflow

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Skill Validation
- Reviewed research-assessor v2.5 skill package from previous conversation
- Validated against skill-creator packaging standards
- Identified 3 violations:
  - PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md (302 lines auxiliary documentation)
  - VERSION_HISTORY.md (195 lines changelog)
  - Erroneous `{schema,checklists,examples}/` directory artifact

### 2. Skill Correction
- Removed all extraneous files and artifacts
- Repackaged as .zip file (upload requirement)
- Added `license: Apache 2.0` to SKILL.md frontmatter
- **Correction:** Removed unsupported `version` field from frontmatter (uploader only accepts: name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata)
- Final package: 52KB with 12 operational files

### 3. Workflow Definition
- Created skill-packaging-workflow.md for project instructions
- Defined clear separation: skill package vs task reports vs GitHub docs
- Established version tracking approach (frontmatter only)
- Documented breaking changes handling (task reports, not in package)

---

## Key Decisions

**Frontmatter Requirements:**
- License: Apache 2.0 added to frontmatter
- Version tracking: External (GitHub releases/tags), not in frontmatter
- Supported frontmatter keys: name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata

**Breaking Changes:**
- Document in task reports when they occur
- User adds to GitHub release notes as needed
- Never in skill package

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Skill package: Operational files only
- Task reports: Work summary, decisions, breaking changes
- GitHub documentation: Created on-request, user-facing

---

## Deliverables

1. **research-assessor-v2.5.zip** - Production-ready skill package
   - 12 operational files (SKILL.md + 11 references)
   - Apache 2.0 license in frontmatter
   - Zero auxiliary documentation
   - 9/9 skill-creator criteria passing

2. **skill-packaging-workflow.md** - Project instructions
   - Packaging checklist
   - Frontmatter requirements (license, not version)
   - Content location guide
   - Examples and decision framework

3. **Validation documents** (from correction process)
   - skill-validation-report.md (initial issues identified)
   - skill-validation-summary.md (post-correction verification)

---

## Status

✅ **Skill package ready for deployment**  
✅ **Workflow documented for future packaging tasks**  
✅ **All deliverables in /mnt/user-data/outputs/**

---

## Notes

- Workflow prevents future packaging drift (no auxiliary docs in skills)
- Clear separation eliminates ambiguity about what belongs where
- On-demand documentation approach reduces unnecessary work
- License in frontmatter (version tracking is external to skill package)
- Frontmatter validation: Only name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata are supported
