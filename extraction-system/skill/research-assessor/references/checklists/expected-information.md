# Expected Information Checklists

## Purpose

These checklists help identify what information SHOULD be present but is MISSING from research papers. We don't penalize absence - we document it for transparency assessment.

## Core Principle

**Expected information varies by:**
- Research domain (archaeology vs biology vs ethnography)
- Method type (survey vs experimental vs computational)
- Claim type (quantitative vs qualitative vs causal)

## Universal Checklists

### For All Quantitative Claims

- [ ] Method specified?
- [ ] Error margins or confidence intervals provided?
- [ ] Sample size reported?
- [ ] Precision justified?
- [ ] Measurement units clear?

### For All Comparative Claims

- [ ] Basis of comparison explicit?
- [ ] What was held constant?
- [ ] Alternative explanations considered?
- [ ] Statistical significance (if applicable)?

### For All Causal Claims

- [ ] Mechanism proposed?
- [ ] Alternative causes ruled out?
- [ ] Temporal sequence established?
- [ ] Confounding factors addressed?

### For All Methods

- [ ] Method choice justified?
- [ ] Alternative methods considered?
- [ ] Implementation details sufficient for replication?
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged?

### For All Measurements

- [ ] Instrument/tool specified?
- [ ] Precision/accuracy reported?
- [ ] Calibration described?
- [ ] Quality control procedures?
- [ ] Observer/operator identified?

## Domain-Specific Checklists

### Literary Studies / Philology

**Primary Source Evidence:**
- [ ] ALL ancient text citations extracted as evidence (not just block quotes)
- [ ] Inline citations to primary sources captured (e.g., "Il. 2.802-6", "Hdt. 8.144")
- [ ] Passing mentions of primary texts included (e.g., "Unlike in Od. 19.172...")
- [ ] Comparative references to other texts/versions recorded
- [ ] Manuscript/edition information specified when discussed

**Decision Rule:**
"When paper references ancient text → evidence item"

Includes:
- Direct quotations (block quotes with translations)
- Inline citations by reference (Il. X.Y, Od. X.Y, Hdt. X.Y)
- Paraphrased passages from primary sources
- Comparative references ("Similar to Hymn to Aphrodite...")
- Manuscript variant discussions

**Why This Matters:**
In literary scholarship, every reference to a primary source is an act of evidence selection. What the scholar chooses to cite—and what they omit—is methodologically significant.

**Common Omissions:**
- [ ] Passing textual references not extracted as evidence
- [ ] Comparative examples mentioned but not captured
- [ ] Critical edition information missing
- [ ] Translation choices not documented
- [ ] Dating/authorship assumptions not explicit

#### Citation Format Guidance by Discipline

**Greco-Roman Literature:**
- Full format: "Homer, Iliad 2.802-6" (author, work, book.lines)
- Abbreviated work: "Il. 2.802-6" (work + book.lines)
- With author abbreviation: "Hom. Il. 2.802-6"
- Single line: "Il. 20.74"
- Line range: "Od. 19.172-77" (book.line-line within same book)
- Multiple passages: Extract separately if spanning different books

**Historical Prose:**
- Author + book.chapter: "Herodotus 8.144", "Hdt. 8.144"
- Book.chapter.section: "Thucydides 1.22.4", "Thuc. 1.22.4"
- Complex hierarchical: "Polybius 6.11.1-3" (book.chapter.sections)
- Fragment collections: "FGrH 115 F 153" (collection + fragment number)

**Biblical/Religious Texts:**
- Old Testament: "Genesis 1:1", "Gen 1:1-3" (book chapter:verse-verse)
- New Testament: "Matthew 5:3-12", "Matt 5:3-12", "1 Corinthians 15:3-8", "1 Cor 15:3-8"
- Apocrypha: "Wisdom of Solomon 2:12", "Wis 2:12"
- Qur'an: "Qur'an 2:255" (sura:ayah), "Al-Baqarah 2:255"
- Rabbinic: "Mishnah Berakhot 1:1", "m. Ber. 1:1"

**Medieval/Manuscript Sources:**
- Manuscript sigla: "MS Bodley 264, fol. 15r" (manuscript + folio + recto/verso)
- Papyri: "P.Oxy. 1086" (collection abbreviation + number)
- Inscriptions: "IG II² 1234" (corpus abbreviation + volume + number)
- Medieval chronicles: "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, MS A, s.a. 793" (manuscript + sub anno)

**Legal/Philosophical Texts:**
- Roman law: "Digest 1.1.1.1" (hierarchical numbering)
- Legal abbreviations: "Inst. 1.2.3" (Institutes book.title.section)
- Plato (Stephanus pagination): "Republic 510b", "Rep. 510b-c"
- Aristotle (Bekker numbers): "Nicomachean Ethics 1094a1-5", "NE 1094a1-5"
- Medieval philosophy: "Summa Theologica Ia.2.3" (part.question.article)

**Preservation principle:** Use author's citation format (don't standardise)
- If author writes "Il. 2.802-6", use "Il. 2.802-6"
- If author writes "Homer, Iliad 2.802-6", use that format
- Consistency matters less than preserving author's scholarly conventions

#### Evidence Type Classification for Historical Sources

**primary_source_textual:**
- Ancient/historical texts under study (Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Biblical texts)
- Extensively analysed passages (main evidence for argument)
- Inline passing references (supporting evidence)
- Comparative textual references ("Unlike in Od. 19.172...")
- **Use when:** Scholar analyses original ancient/historical text

**secondary_source_textual:**
- Modern scholars citing ancient sources as historical evidence
- Historical accounts used as evidence (e.g., Gibbon on Rome)
- Critical editions or translations discussed substantively
- **Use when:** Modern interpretation/account serves as evidence, not primary text itself

**archaeological:**
- Physical artefacts mentioned (pottery, tools, buildings)
- Site features and stratigraphy
- Material culture evidence (burial goods, settlement patterns)
- **Use when:** Physical remains serve as evidence

**inscriptional:**
- Ancient inscriptions (IG, CIL, SEG collections)
- Epigraphy, graffiti, ostraca
- Papyri (documentary, not literary)
- Coin legends, seal impressions
- **Use when:** Epigraphic evidence cited

**Decision guide:**
- Literary analysis of Homer → primary_source_textual
- Historian citing inscription about Alexander → inscriptional
- Archaeologist describing pottery assemblage → archaeological
- Scholar citing Tacitus on Germanic tribes → primary_source_textual
- Scholar citing modern historian's account → secondary_source_textual

#### Extraction Boundary Cases

**Include as evidence (✓):**
- ✓ Every citation to primary source, even single-line references
- ✓ Paraphrases clearly sourced to ancient text ("Herodotus describes...")
- ✓ Comparative mentions ("Unlike in Od. 19.172, the Iliad passage...")
- ✓ Edition/manuscript discussions when substantive (variant readings)
- ✓ Block quotations with translations
- ✓ Author's own translations of primary text passages
- ✓ Bundled citations treated as separate items (see below)

**Exclude from evidence (✗):**
- ✗ Generic genre references ("epic tradition", "Homeric style", "biblical narrative")
- ✗ Scholarly debate citations without primary source grounding
- ✗ Author's interpretive synthesis not tied to specific passage
- ✗ Original language text in isolation (extract from English translation in body instead)
- ✗ Theoretical framework discussions (unless grounded in specific textual evidence)
- ✗ Background/context claims not sourced to specific texts

**Boundary decision rule:**
"Does the author cite this source as direct evidence for their argument?"
- YES → Extract as evidence item
- NO → Likely a claim, context, or interpretive synthesis

**Bundled citations handling:**

When paper cites multiple passages together:
"See Il. 2.802-6, 4.433-38, 20.74 for linguistic diversity"

**Extract as:**
- **Separate evidence items** (E001, E002, E003)
- Each with own verbatim_quote from body text
- Use related_evidence array to cross-reference: `"related_evidence": ["E002", "E003"]`
- Document bundling in notes: "Part of bundled citation with E002, E003"

**Rationale:** Each passage may support different claims or aspects of argument

**Paraphrase vs quotation:**

**Direct quotation** → Extract as primary evidence
- Uses quotation marks or block formatting
- Author translates/presents ancient text directly
- `verbatim_quote` = author's translation

**Paraphrase with citation** → Extract as primary evidence
- Author summarises ancient text content with citation
- Captures author's reading/interpretation of passage
- `verbatim_quote` = author's paraphrase + citation

**Synthesis without specific citation** → Likely a claim, not evidence
- Interpretive statement about texts generally
- No specific passage referenced
- May reference implicit arguments instead

**Example:**
- ✓ Evidence: "In Il. 2.802-6, Hektor instructs commanders to lead their own polis contingents because of linguistic diversity"
- ✗ Not evidence: "The Iliad shows awareness of linguistic diversity among allies"

#### Verification Protocol for Completeness

**Post-extraction citation scan procedure:**

**Purpose:** Ensure ALL primary source citations captured (prevent under-extraction)

**Method:**
1. Extract full PDF text: `pdftotext source.pdf temp_fulltext.txt`
2. Run discipline-specific grep patterns:

**For Greco-Roman sources:**
```bash
grep -oE "(Il\.|Iliad|Hom\. Il\.) [0-9]+\.[0-9]+(–|-|--)[0-9]+" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
grep -oE "(Od\.|Odyssey|Hom\. Od\.) [0-9]+\.[0-9]+(–|-|--)[0-9]+" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
grep -oE "(Hdt\.|Herodotus) [0-9]+\.[0-9]+" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
```

**For Biblical sources:**
```bash
grep -oE "(Gen|Genesis|Exod|Exodus|Matt|Matthew|Rom|Romans) [0-9]+:[0-9]+" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
```

**For philosophical texts:**
```bash
grep -oE "(Plato|Rep\.|Republic) [0-9]+[a-e]" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
grep -oE "(Aristotle|NE|Nicomachean Ethics) [0-9]+[a-b][0-9]+" fulltext.txt | sort | uniq
```

3. **Compare scan results against extraction:**
   - Count unique citations found in scan
   - Count evidence items extracted
   - Identify any systematic misses

4. **Add missing citations:**
   - Create evidence items for any substantive references missed
   - Re-run validation after additions

5. **Exclude sub-references:**
   - Il. 2.805-6 within Il. 2.802-6 → Don't extract separately
   - Od. 19.175-77 within Od. 19.172-77 → Part of larger passage
   - Check context: Is this a distinct reference or part of extended analysis?

**Target completeness:** 100% of substantive primary source citations captured

**Example from Ross 2005:**
- Initial extraction: 15 evidence items
- Comprehensive scan: Found 17 unique citations
- Added 2 missing: Il. 2.862-63, Il. 3.181-90
- **Final: 100% completeness verified**

**When to use verification:**
- Literary/philological papers (always)
- Historical papers with heavy source citation
- When evidence count seems low for paper type
- When reviewer questions completeness

1. Review aggregated missing information
2. Flag critical gaps (assessment blockers)
3. Note patterns of missing information

### During Assessment:
1. Use missing information to inform transparency scores
2. Distinguish: unavailable vs unreported

## Comprehensive Checklists

Full, detailed domain-specific checklists with examples are available in project knowledge:
- Archaeology checklists (survey, excavation, analysis)
- Biology checklists (field, lab, statistical)
- Ethnography checklists (qualitative methods)

These can be consulted for comprehensive expected information frameworks.

## Remember

- **Absence is data** - Document what's missing, don't ignore it
- **Context matters** - Expected information varies by domain and method
- **Don't penalize** - These are transparency indicators, not quality judgments
- **Be systematic** - Apply checklists consistently
- **Flag critical gaps** - Note when absence blocks assessment
