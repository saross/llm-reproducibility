# Research Assessment Schema v2.5 - Complete Guide

## Overview

This schema defines six object types for extracting research methodology and argumentation:

**Claims & Evidence:**
- `evidence` - Raw observations, measurements, data
- `claims` - Assertions that interpret or generalize
- `implicit_arguments` - Unstated assumptions and logical implications

**RDMAP (Research Design, Methods, Protocols):**
- `research_designs` - Strategic decisions (WHY research framed this way)
- `methods` - Tactical approaches (WHAT was done at high level)
- `protocols` - Operational procedures (HOW specifically implemented)

---

## Schema v2.5 Updates: Hallucination Prevention

**Version 2.5 introduces mandatory sourcing requirements to prevent fabricated content.**

### Critical Changes

**For Evidence & Claims (Explicit Content):**
- `verbatim_quote` now **REQUIRED** (was optional in v2.4)
- Must contain exact text from paper stating this content
- If quote doesn't exist → don't extract the item
- Verification: Can you point to the exact sentence that says this?

**For Implicit Arguments (Implicit Content):**
- `trigger_text` array **REQUIRED** - verbatim passages that imply the argument
- `trigger_locations` array **REQUIRED** - parallel to trigger_text, one location per passage
- `inference_reasoning` **REQUIRED** - explanation connecting triggers to argument
- Must have passages that together imply the argument
- Verification: Can you point to specific passages that together support this inference?

**For RDMAP Objects (Design/Method/Protocol):**

*Explicit RDMAP (status = "explicit"):*
- Documented in Methods section with procedural details
- Requires `verbatim_quote` from Methods section
- Status field: `design_status`, `method_status`, or `protocol_status` = `"explicit"`

*Implicit RDMAP (status = "implicit"):*
- NOT documented in Methods section
- Either mentioned but undocumented, OR inferred from Results/Discussion
- Requires `trigger_text` + `trigger_locations` + `inference_reasoning`
- Requires `implicit_metadata` object (basis, transparency_gap, assessability_impact, reconstruction_confidence)
- Status field set to `"implicit"`

**Source Verification:**
- All items have `source_verification` object for Pass 6 validation
- Tracks: location_verified, quote_verified, content_aligned
- Enables automated quality checks

### Field Population Timeline

**IMPORTANT:** Different fields are populated at different workflow stages.

**Passes 1-5 (Extraction):** Populate the actual extraction content
- Evidence items: `verbatim_quote`, `location`, `evidence_text`, `evidence_type`
- Claims: `claim_text`, `verbatim_quote`, `supports_claims`, `claim_type`
- Implicit Arguments: `trigger_text`, `trigger_locations`, `inference_reasoning`, `implicit_metadata`
- RDMAP items: `*_text`, `*_type`, plus:
  - Explicit: `verbatim_quote`, `location`
  - Implicit: `trigger_text`, `trigger_locations`, `inference_reasoning`, `implicit_metadata`

**Pass 6 (Validation):** Populate the verification metadata ONLY
- Adds `source_verification` object to each item:
  - `location_verified`: Does stated location exist in paper and discuss topic?
  - `quote_verified`: Is verbatim_quote found at stated location?
  - `content_aligned`: Does item content match what quote/triggers actually state?
- **Does NOT modify** extraction content (evidence_text, claim_text, etc.)
- **Does NOT add/remove** items from arrays
- Only adds validation QA metadata to existing items

**Key distinction:** Pass 6 validates and annotates the extraction, it does not perform extraction.

### Why This Matters

**The hallucination problem:** LLMs may fabricate plausible-sounding details rather than faithfully extracting what papers state. v2.5 requires rigorous sourcing discipline:

- **Cannot extract without source:** Every item must have verbatim_quote OR trigger_text
- **Location tracking:** Every source must have precise location
- **Verification enabled:** Pass 6 can validate all extractions systematically
- **Zero tolerance:** Fabricated content is catastrophic for credibility assessment

## Evidence Object

**Purpose:** Raw observations, measurements, or data requiring minimal interpretation

**Required fields (v2.5):**
- `evidence_id`: String matching pattern `E###` (E001, E002, ...)
- `evidence_text`: String describing the observation
- `evidence_type`: Enum of observation types (see below)
- `verbatim_quote`: **REQUIRED** - Exact text from paper stating this observation

**evidence_type values:**

**For empirical/quantitative papers:**
- `quantitative_observation` - Numerical measurements, counts, rates, frequencies
- `qualitative_observation` - Descriptive observations, categorical data, patterns
- `comparative_observation` - Comparative relationships, differences between groups/conditions
- `measurement` - Instrument-based measurements with precision/error specification

**For literary/historical papers:**
- `primary_source_textual` - Citations from ancient/historical texts under study
  - Use when: Scholar analyses original ancient/historical text (Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Biblical texts)
  - Examples: Il. 2.802-6, Hdt. 8.144, Genesis 1:1, Republic 510b
- `secondary_source_textual` - Modern scholars citing ancient sources as evidence
  - Use when: Modern interpretation/historical account serves as evidence (not primary text itself)
  - Examples: Gibbon on Rome, modern historian's account cited as evidence
- `archaeological` - Physical artefacts, site features, material evidence
  - Use when: Physical remains serve as evidence
  - Examples: Pottery assemblages, architectural features, stratigraphy, burial goods
- `inscriptional` - Epigraphic evidence, ancient inscriptions, documentary papyri
  - Use when: Inscribed/written materials on physical media (not literary texts)
  - Examples: IG inscriptions, CIL corpus, P.Oxy. papyri, coin legends, graffiti

**Selection guidance:**
- Literary analysis of Homer → `primary_source_textual`
- Historian citing ancient inscription → `inscriptional`
- Archaeologist describing pottery → `archaeological`
- Scholar citing Tacitus → `primary_source_textual`
- Scholar citing modern historian's account → `secondary_source_textual`
- Quantitative site data → `quantitative_observation`
- Lab measurements → `measurement`

**Key fields:**
- `location`: `{section, page, start_paragraph, end_paragraph}` - Where the verbatim_quote appears
- `source_verification`: Populated in Pass 6 (location_verified, quote_verified, content_aligned)
- `declared_uncertainty`: Author-stated uncertainty (ranges, confidence intervals)
- `expected_uncertainty_missing`: Uncertainty we would expect but is absent

  "evidence_text": "Survey collected 8,343 features across 22 sites",
  "evidence_type": "quantitative_observation",
  "verbatim_quote": "We collected 8,343 features across 22 sites during the survey",
  "location": {"section": "Results", "page": 8, "start_paragraph": 2, "end_paragraph": 2},
  "supports_claims": ["C015"],
  "source_verification": {
    "location_verified": true,
    "quote_verified": true,

  "argument_text": "GPS accuracy is sufficient for archaeological survey purposes",
  "type": "methodological_assumption",
  "trigger_text": [
    "GPS units were used to record artifact locations",
    "spatial analysis conducted at site level",
    "precision adequate for landscape-scale interpretation"
  ],
  "trigger_locations": [
    {"section": "Methods", "start_paragraph": 2, "end_paragraph": 2},
    {"section": "Methods", "start_paragraph": 5, "end_paragraph": 5},

Conditional objects (`research_framing`, `theoretical_framework`, `study_design`, `scope`, `positionality`) are **FULLY OPTIONAL**. You can create minimal Research Designs with just the three required fields above. Only populate conditional objects when detail is present and beneficial for assessment. This reduces consolidation pressure while preserving assessment capability for hypothesis timing, theoretical grounding, and design rationale.

**Key fields:**
- `enables_methods`: Array of method IDs this design enables
- `reasoning_approach`: `inductive | deductive | abductive | mixed`
- `hypothesis_timing`: When hypotheses were formulated
- `implicit_assumptions`: Design assumptions

```json
{
  "design_id": "RD001",
  "design_text": "Comparative study of mobile vs traditional data collection",
  "design_type": "study_design",
  "study_design": {
    "design_type": "comparative",
    "rationale": "Test mobile platform effectiveness"
  },
  "enables_methods": ["M003", "M008"],
  "reasoning_approach": {"approach": "abductive"}
}
```

## Method Object

**Purpose:** Tactical approaches about WHAT was done at high level

**Required fields:**

  "method_type": "data_collection",
  "implements_designs": ["RD001"],
  "realized_through_protocols": ["P023", "P024"],
  "validated_by_evidence": ["E046"]
}
```

## Protocol Object

**Purpose:** Operational procedures about HOW specifically it was done

**Required fields:**

## RDMAP Explicit vs Implicit (v2.5)

**All RDMAP objects (Research Design, Method, Protocol) have status fields in v2.5:**
- `design_status`, `method_status`, or `protocol_status`
- Values: `"explicit"` | `"implicit"`

### Explicit RDMAP (status = "explicit")

**Documented in Methods section with procedural details**

**Sourcing requirements:**
- Must have `verbatim_quote` from Methods section
- Location should be in Methods (or subsections)
- Verification: Same 3-step process as Evidence & Claims

**Example - Explicit Method:**
```json
{
  "method_id": "M003",
  "method_text": "Systematic pedestrian survey using 50m wide transects with complete surface coverage",
  "method_type": "data_collection",
  "method_status": "explicit",
  "verbatim_quote": "Teams conducted systematic pedestrian survey walking 50m wide transects to ensure complete surface coverage of each site",
  "location": {"section": "Methods", "subsection": "Survey Strategy", "start_paragraph": 2, "end_paragraph": 2},
  "source_verification": {
    "location_verified": true,
    "quote_verified": true,
    "content_aligned": true,
    "verified_by": "validator"
  }
}
```

### Implicit RDMAP (status = "implicit")

**NOT documented in Methods section**

Two types of implicit RDMAP:
1. **mentioned_undocumented**: Tool/approach named but details not provided
2. **inferred_from_results**: Never mentioned, inferred from outputs/results

**Sourcing requirements:**
- Must have `trigger_text` array (passages implying procedure)
- Must have `trigger_locations` array (parallel to trigger_text)
- Must have `inference_reasoning` (explanation of inference)
- Must have `implicit_metadata` object (basis, transparency_gap, assessability_impact, reconstruction_confidence)
- Verification: Same 3-step process as Implicit Arguments

**Example - Implicit Protocol (mentioned_undocumented):**
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "P015",
  "protocol_text": "Standard consumer GPS procedures with estimated ±5-10m horizontal accuracy typical of handheld units without differential correction",
  "protocol_type": "recording",
  "protocol_status": "implicit",
  "trigger_text": [
    "handheld GPS units were used",
    "Spatial accuracy adequate for site-level analysis"
  ],
  "trigger_locations": [
    {"section": "Methods", "start_paragraph": 1, "end_paragraph": 1},
    {"section": "Discussion", "start_paragraph": 3, "end_paragraph": 3}
  ],
  "inference_reasoning": "Methods mentions handheld GPS but provides no accuracy specifications, calibration procedures, or equipment models. Discussion states accuracy 'adequate for site-level analysis' suggesting general-purpose consumer GPS. Standard consumer handheld GPS (without differential correction) provides ±5-10m accuracy, consistent with 'site-level' spatial resolution.",
  "implicit_metadata": {
    "basis": "mentioned_undocumented",
    "transparency_gap": "GPS units mentioned but no documentation of: equipment models, accuracy requirements, calibration procedures, differential correction use, or quality control checks",
    "assessability_impact": "Cannot verify equipment specifications or assess data quality procedures. Cannot determine if accuracy claims match equipment capabilities.",
    "reconstruction_confidence": "medium"
  },
  "implements_methods": ["M003"],
  "source_verification": {
    "location_verified": true,
    "quote_verified": true,
    "content_aligned": true,
    "verification_notes": "Implicit protocol reasonably inferred from triggers. Conservative reconstruction appropriate.",
    "verified_by": "validator"
  }
}
```

**Example - Implicit Protocol (inferred_from_results):**
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "P018",
  "protocol_text": "Sub-meter GPS accuracy achieved through differential correction or high-precision receivers",
  "protocol_type": "measurement",
  "protocol_status": "implicit",
  "trigger_text": [
    "coordinate accuracy of ±0.5m reported",
    "precision suitable for feature-level analysis"
  ],
  "trigger_locations": [
    {"section": "Results", "start_paragraph": 1, "end_paragraph": 1},
    {"section": "Results", "start_paragraph": 4, "end_paragraph": 4}
  ],
  "inference_reasoning": "Results report 0.5m accuracy but Methods doesn't explain how achieved. This precision exceeds standard consumer GPS (±5-10m), requiring either differential correction or survey-grade equipment. Cannot determine which without documentation.",
  "implicit_metadata": {
    "basis": "inferred_from_results",
    "transparency_gap": "Methods section completely silent on GPS procedures. Precision of 0.5m cannot be achieved with consumer GPS, implying specialized equipment or correction, but no procedures documented.",
    "assessability_impact": "Cannot assess which high-precision approach used. Cannot evaluate equipment quality, calibration practices, or whether accuracy claims realistic for chosen method.",
    "reconstruction_confidence": "low"
  },
  "source_verification": {
    "location_verified": true,
    "quote_verified": true,
    "content_aligned": true,
    "verification_notes": "Precision mentioned implies specialized procedures but inference weak. Reconstruction confidence appropriately low.",
    "verified_by": "validator"
  }
}
```

**Critical distinction:**
- Explicit RDMAP: "Here's what we did" (verbatim_quote)
- Implicit RDMAP: "Here's what they must have done based on clues" (trigger_text + inference)

---

## Cross-Reference Architecture

All cross-references use simple string ID arrays:

**Claims reference evidence:**
```json
"supported_by_evidence": ["E001", "E003", "E012"]
```

**Evidence references claims:**
```json
"supports_claims": ["C015", "C027"]
```

**RDMAP hierarchy:**
```json
// Design enables methods
"enables_methods": ["M003", "M007"]

// Method implements designs and uses protocols
"implements_designs": ["RD001"]
"realized_through_protocols": ["P011", "P012"]

// Protocol implements methods
"implements_methods": ["M003"]
```

**Cross-domain references:**
```json
// Method validated by evidence
"validated_by_evidence": ["E046"]

// Method justified by claim
"justification_claim": "C027"

// Claim supports method
"supports_method": "M003"
```

## Consolidation Metadata

All consolidated items must include:

```json
"consolidation_metadata": {
  "consolidated_from": ["P1_E001", "P1_E002"],
  "consolidation_type": "granularity_reduction | compound_finding | ...",
  "information_preserved": "complete | lossy_granularity | lossy_redundancy",
  "granularity_available": "Description of finer detail in source",
  "rationale": "Why consolidation was appropriate"
}
```

## Location Tracking

All objects include location for traceability:

```json
// Single paragraph
"location": {
  "section": "Methods",
  "page": 5,
  "start_paragraph": 2,
  "end_paragraph": 2,
  "sentence": 3  // optional
}

// Paragraph range (content spans paragraphs 2-4)
"location": {
  "section": "Results",
  "page": 8,
  "start_paragraph": 2,
  "end_paragraph": 4
}
```

**Note:** For single paragraphs, `start_paragraph` equals `end_paragraph`. For ranges, `end_paragraph` > `start_paragraph` indicates content spanning multiple consecutive paragraphs.
