# llm-reproducibility — Continuity (Living Doc)

**Purpose:** cross-session state, pending work, and a session-by-session log
for this repo. Updated in place at session end (no new file per session).

**Status: SEED.** This file bootstraps the wiki-style documentation layout in
this repo. The repo is otherwise still on the **legacy `docs/notes/` layout**
(`docs/notes/working-notes.md` + `docs/notes/reflections/`) and has no
`user-observations.md`. This file exists to (a) carry the two pending
infrastructure tasks below across sessions, and (b) **initiate the migration**
to the current per-project wiki layout. It was created 2026-06-07 from a
session working primarily in the `2026-mq-llm-dh-judgement-paper-b` repo (the
matching-grade PDF extractor merged here as PR #1).

**How to update at session end** (per the canonical convention —
`~/personal-assistant/global-claude-md/handoff-protocol.md`):

1. Mark done items in place: `[ ]` → `[x] YYYY-MM-DD`; never delete.
2. Add new items as `[ ]` with a brief note.
3. Append a new "Session log" entry at the bottom (most recent first).
4. Carry forward open questions.

## Repo state (2026-06-07)

- `main` @ `1c4650e` (merge of PR #1). Working tree clean.
- **PR #1** added a matching-grade extraction layer to
  `extraction-system/scripts/pdf_processing/`: `normalise_for_matching`,
  `normalise_text_readable`, `PDFExtractor.extract_pages` (per-page text with
  page-index + section locators), and promoted cleaners (`strip_running_headers`,
  `drop_fragment_headings`, `split_body_references`, `strip_affiliation_tail`,
  `looks_like_heading`). First tests in the repo at
  `extraction-system/scripts/pdf_processing/tests/test_matching_layer.py`
  (24/24 pass). Additive/opt-in: existing `extract()` behaviour unchanged.
  Built for an annotated-bibliography (AB+) pipeline in the paper-b project;
  design context in that repo's
  `planning/pdf-extractor-consolidation-plan-2026-06-07.md`.

## Pending tasks

### A. Git hygiene — untrack the committed virtualenv  [ ]

The repo tracks the **entire `venv/`** — **2,114 files** (verified 2026-06-07:
`git ls-files | grep -c '^venv/'`), including thousands of `.pyc`. `.gitignore`
**already** lists `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, and `*.py[cod]` (lines ~5–10), so
these were force-added or pre-date the ignore (tracked files are not
auto-ignored).

Fix (own commit/PR — large, mechanical):

```bash
git rm -r --cached venv
git commit -m "chore: untrack committed virtualenv (already in .gitignore)"
```

Caveats:

- ~2,114 deletions from the index (files stay on disk). Do it standalone.
- Anyone relying on the committed venv must recreate it:
  `python -m venv venv && venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` — note this
  in the commit body and/or README.
- After: `git ls-files | grep -c '^venv/'` should be `0`.
- Also sweep any other tracked bytecode outside venv:
  `git ls-files | grep -E '__pycache__|\.pyc$' | grep -v '^venv/'` (should be
  empty — PR #1 already removed the one stray
  `extraction-system/scripts/pdf_processing/__pycache__/pdf_cleaner.cpython-312.pyc`).

### B. Migrate docs to the wiki-style layout  [ ]

This repo uses the **legacy `docs/notes/` layout** and lacks `continuity.md`
(this seed) and `user-observations.md`. Target = the canonical per-project
wiki layout (authoritative reference: `~/personal-assistant/wiki/index.md`,
"PA project layer" table; migration precedent:
`~/personal-assistant/wiki/planning/wiki-index-draft.md`).

| Artefact | Target | Source now |
|---|---|---|
| `continuity.md` | `wiki/continuity.md` | **this file (seed, in place)** |
| `index.md` | `wiki/index.md` | new (small index; model on PA's) |
| `working-notes.md` | `wiki/working-notes.md` | `docs/notes/working-notes.md` |
| `reflections/` | `wiki/reflections/` | `docs/notes/reflections/*` (session-log, session-reflection, abductive-reasoning, llm-observations) |
| `user-observations.md` | `wiki/user-observations.md` | new (model on paper-b's `docs/notes/user-observations.md`) |
| `planning/` | `wiki/planning/` | repo-root `planning/` |
| Documentation | decide: keep `docs/` vs `wiki/docs/` | repo-root `docs/` |

Steps:

1. `git mv` legacy files into `wiki/` (preserve history).
2. Create `wiki/index.md` + `wiki/user-observations.md` from the convention.
3. Add wiki frontmatter (`title`/`tags`/`created`/`updated`/`status`) to
   migrated pages; tags from the 24-term vocabulary in PA's `wiki/index.md`.
4. Add a "Session continuity → `wiki/continuity.md`" pointer to this repo's
   `CLAUDE.md` (belt-and-braces; the global session-start protocol already
   reads `wiki/continuity.md`).
5. Resolve the `docs/` disposition (see open decision).

Caveats:

- `docs/` here is large and public-facing (assessment guides, background
  research, FAIR docs) — unlike PA's, it may warrant staying at repo root
  rather than moving under `wiki/docs/`. Decide deliberately.
- `/reflect`, `/observe`, `/handoff` are layout-aware and fall back to legacy
  paths; after migration they target `wiki/`.

## Open decisions

- [ ] `docs/` disposition: stay at repo root vs move to `wiki/docs/` (task B).
- [ ] Sequencing: do A and B as separate commits/PRs (recommended — A is large
  and mechanical, B is structural) vs bundle.

## Session log

### 2026-06-07 — seed created

Created this `wiki/continuity.md` as the seed of the wiki migration, from a
session centred on the paper-b repo (matching-grade PDF extractor, merged here
as **PR #1**, `1c4650e`; 24/24 tests; validated on real PDFs). Logged the two
pending infrastructure tasks: untrack the committed `venv/` (2,114 files) and
migrate docs to the wiki layout. No other changes to this repo in that session
beyond PR #1.
